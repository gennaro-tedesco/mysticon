Adept	Mostly used to specifically describe those able to interpret the Deck of Dragons.
Adjunct	The Adjunct serves as the Malazan Throne's supreme field commander and voice, empowered to lead Imperial legions, enforce edicts, and depose generals, while their otataral weapon nullifies sorcery around them.
Ahkrast Korvalain	Forkrul Assail Hold. It granted its wielders' voices great magical powers over the psyche. The hold itself was thought to create the ability for thought and consciousness in a world where thought never existed before.
Aral Gamelon	The Path of Demons.
Ascendant	Ascendants were individuals who had transcended death. In the time of the First Empire they had been called First Heroes. Ascendants could become gods if they gained sufficient following among mortals, but they were not gods by default. Those without worshippers were considered unchained, or Unaligned in the language of the Deck of Dragons. Gods who lost their worshippers remained ascendant, but were effectively emasculated unless worship was somehow renewed.<br>
Bhederin	Massive shaggy bison native to Genabackis, running in herds that can reach half a million. Bulls are huge and territorial; coats are reddish-brown with humped shoulders and short horns. The Rhivi follow their migrations, walk among and even ride them while also hunting them; cousins of the now-extinct bhed, their pounding hooves keep the plains’ thin soil packed.
Assassins' Guild	Darujhistan’s Assassins’ Guild was founded almost with the city; nobles often paid it to remove rivals and threats, and the ruling T’orrud Cabal tolerated it because it kept the nobility’s vendettas in check. The Guild was run by a master or mistress—called the Master of Assassins—and made up of rival clans, each based in its own “nest.”
Bonecaster	A Bonecaster is a shaman of the Imass people, and later the T'lan Imass. They are practitioners of magic, with T'lan Imass Bonecasters specifically utilizing the Warren of Tellann. Historically, they played a crucial role in the ritual that transformed the Imass into the undead T'lan Imass. Their abilities include 'spiritwalking' to perceive visions of the present and future, and sensing the earth to locate others or track prey. They are sometimes identified by their characteristic lack of weapons.
Chance	A sword dedicated to Oponn, the Twin Jesters of Chance. This weapon embodies the chaotic nature of luck and probability.
Chain of Dogs	The brutal overland evacuation of Malazan refugees across Seven Cities led by Coltaine’s 7th Army during the Whirlwind Rebellion.
Crimson Guard	Famous mercenary company commanded by the deposed Prince K'azz D'Avore, long-time enemies of the Malazan Empire and allies of Caladan Brood on Genabackis. They opposed the Empire on four continents and handed it its first major defeat at Stratem; their sigil was a silver dragon on a red field worn as a brooch on crimson cloaks, they wore blood-red tabards, and their native tongue was Talian.
Claw	The Claw is the elite intelligence and assassination agency of the Malazan Empire, answering directly to the Empress. They are a highly secretive and feared organization, known for their ruthless efficiency and unwavering loyalty. Claws are trained in a variety of skills, including espionage, infiltration, and assassination. They operate both within the Empire, to root out rebellion and corruption, and externally, to advance the Empire's interests. Each Claw undergoes intense physical and psychological conditioning, and their hands are surgically altered to resemble talons, which they use as deadly weapons.
D'ivers	A higher order of shape-shifting that allows an individual to take multiple forms simultaneously, splitting into many separate beings. This is more complex and dangerous than Soletaken transformation.
Deadhouse Warren	A specific section or gateway within the Imperial Warren.
Deck of Dragons|Fatid	The Deck of Dragons, sometimes called the Fatid, was the dominant oracular system across the world (except Lether, which used the Tiles); it could one day be succeeded by the Coins. The Deck comprised cards depicting members of the pantheon, adding new ones as needed, mostly aligned to Houses with a few unaligned cards that could even animate during a reading.<br>
Denaeth Rusen	Elder Warren of the Seas, Mael's Warren.
Denul	The Path of Healing.
Dragnipur	A sword wielded by Anomander Rake, forged by the Elder God Draconus. This legendary weapon traps the souls of those it slays within it, chaining them to pull a wagon bearing the Gate of Darkness for eternity.
Drift Avalii	A mysterious and ancient island, believed by some to be a former flying fortress. It is a significant location in the Malazan world, holding many secrets, including the presence of a mysterious 'sleeper' within it. The island is a place of power and is associated with the Throne of Shadow.
D'riss	The Path of Stone, turgid magenta, the colour of earth magic.
Elder Warrens	These are realms mostly used by some of the older races. Some are also described as Holds.
Finnest	An object used as a repository of power by a Jaghut. These artifacts contain immense magical energy and can be extremely dangerous if disturbed or misused.
Gathering	The term marked key convocations: the First Gathering of the Imass when Bonecaster Olar Ethil led the Ritual of Tellann 298,665 years before Burn's Sleep to bind them as T'lan Imass; The Barghast Gathering near Capustan where warchief Humbrall Taur summoned the White Face clans—Gilk, Barahn and others—to decide alliance and survival against the Pannion Domin.
Grallin	A figure in a legend Apsalar recounts, called the Lord of the Deep Waters. Grallin’s Sea on the moon bears his name; he lives in underwater gardens and will one day descend to take chosen mortals back to live in peace in his Gardens of the Moon.
Great Ravens|Ravens	The Great Ravens were massive ravens, larger than the norm, who were "born like maggots from the rotting corpse-flesh of the Chained God when he was pulled down into the world". As a result, they carried within them a fragment of his power. They were largely impervious to most forms of magic, with chaos being a notable exception. For them, magic was 'ambrosia', and if attacked with sorcery they would only grow stronger, more immune, and their life-spans - already centuries-long - would be even more extended.
High Fist	The title of a commander of armies in a Malazan Campaign. The High Fist was the highest ranking officer in a theatre of operations. Its naval equivalent rank was an Admiral. A High Fist could only be overruled by the Emperor or Empress him/herself or, by extension, his or her Adjunct.
High Mage	The title of High Mage was used for both military and civilian mages. In the military, it typically referred to the commander of a mage cadre in the Malazan Army. Among civilians, it was used for mages with particularly powerful skills. Some individuals were considered "Natural High Mages" for their talent, even if not officially recognized. The highest rank was the Imperial High Mage, the top-ranking mage in the entire Malazan Army.<br>
Hood's Path	The Path of Death.
Hounds of Shadow|Hound of Shadow|Hound	Servants of High House Shadow, believed to be more ancient than the Shadow Realm itself. Baran, Blind, Doan, Ganrod, Gear, Rood, and Shan: they are described as large, black, spectral dogs with glowing individually coloured eyes, relentless in their pursuit of prey.<br>
House Shadow	Mutable House in the Deck of Dragons, aligned with Shadowthrone and Cotillion, prowling the liminal paths of Shadow while recruiting wanderers and rogues for motives hidden from gods and mortals alike.
Imperial Warren	The Warren of the Malazan Empire, connecting many locations.

Kurald Liosan	Tiste Liosan Elder Warren of Light. Also known as Kurald Thyrllan.
Meanas	The Path of Shadow and Illusion.
Mockra	The Path of the Mind.
Moon's Spawn	Also known as the Tiste Andii's Fang of Darkness, a floating fortress or skykeep containing a city commanded by the Tiste Andii. According to Anomander Rake, the city was home to children, priests, and several scholarly warlocks. The fortress sheltered a vast flock of Great Ravens that nested in the crags and caverns of its basalt surface, and within its inner chambers lay the lair of Silanah, the Eleint.<br>It appeared as a vertically-shaped oblong with no visible signs of construction on its exterior, apart from a small ledge with a recessed doorway leading inside. Its floating nature rendered it immune to siege, and even the undead Logros T'lan Imass were unwilling or unable to assault its magical defenses.<br>
Omtose Phellack|Phellack	Omtose Phellack is the Jaghut Elder Warren of Ice. It is a frigid, nearly airless domain of jagged blue-green ice. It is said to provide the cold necessary to balance the fire and heat of existence. The T'lan Imass are drawn to its unveiling, and as a result, the warren has been breached many times over the millennia.
Otataral	A rare, reddish ore negating magic traditionally wielded by Imperial Adjuncts. It also prevented mages from accessing or opening their Warrens and prolonged exposure to refined ore could drive them insane. It is not clear if this was due to the Otataral itself or to the lack of access to their Warren. Even after long exposure, mages might be able to regain their powers as long as they were removed from the Otataral source, especially if the Otataral was of low quality.
Quorl	Huge dragonfly-like creature native to Genabackis, often used as a mount by the Tiste Andii. They were domesticated by the Moranth and used as a means of transportation for both goods and people.<br>
Rashan	The Warren of Dark, a Path of sorcery associated with shadow and concealment, commonly worked by Imperial mages such as Tayschrenn. Anathema to Thyr, the human Warren of Light.<br>
Ruse	The Path of the Sea.
Serc	The Path of the Sky.
Soletaken	An order of shape-shifting that allows an individual to take a single alternate form. Unlike D'ivers, Soletaken transform into one creature rather than splitting into multiple beings.
Starvald Demelain	The Tiam Warren, the First Warren, Warren of Dragons and Chaos.
Telas	The Path of Fire.
Tellann	The Elder Warren of the T'lan Imass. Once the Elder Warren of Fire, it was altered by the Ritual of Tellann, which transformed the Imass into the undead T'lan Imass. It is described as not just a source of magic, but also a "time," a place defined by "when" rather than "where." The warren is accessible to the T'lan Imass, allowing them to travel vast distances by turning to dust and riding the winds.
Tennes	The Path of the Land.
The Path of Hands	Legendary route across Seven Cities for soletaken and D'ivers seeking ascension, converging on the Azath House Tremorlor during the events of Deadhouse Gates.
The Paths	These are the Warrens most easily accessible to human mages and priests, used as a source of power.
The T'orrud Cabal	The Cabal of Darujhistan, a secretive organization of powerful mages and alchemists who protect the city from magical threats and maintain the balance of power.
The Tyrant Kings	The ancient rulers of Darujhistan who once held absolute power over the city. Their tyrannical reign ended long ago, but their legacy still haunts the city's history and architecture.
Thyr	Warren of Light, a Path of sorcery of blinding radiance and wards, commonly worked by Imperial battle-mages such as Tattersail. Anathema to Rashan, the human Warren of Dark.<br>
Warren	A realm from which mages, priests, shamans, and the like, who might use magic, drew their power. Structurally these Warrens were divided into two classes: Elder Warrens, which were associated with a particular race; and the Paths, which were those Warrens most commonly accessed by humans and which were derived from K'rul's blood. However, not all realms described as Warrens fit that description; The Abyss was named a Warren but seemed to be used only as a means of travel rather than a source of power. It is also possible that there was a difference on how some Warrens like the Abyss were created.<br><br><i>"The Warrens of Magic dwelt in the beyond. Find the gate and nudge it open a crack. What leaks out is yours to shape. Open yourself to the Warren that comes to you - that finds you. Draw forth its power - as much as your body and soul are capable of containing - but remember, when the body fails, the gate closes." (Tattersail)</i>
Warrens of Chaos	The miasmic paths between the Warrens, turbulent and dangerous transitional spaces where the boundaries between magical realms blur and dissolve into raw chaos.
Wheel of Ages	Mythic construct in Darujhistan’s catacombs built by Icarium; a massive time-measuring device whose purpose and readings are lost even to its creator’s fractured memory.
Whirlwind Rebellion	Seven Cities uprising sparked by the Whirlwind’s prophecy in Raraku; Sha'ik rallies tribes against Malazan rule, drawing the Chain of Dogs response.
