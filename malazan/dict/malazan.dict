The name 'Seguleh' is an old word for 'The Anvil,' hinting at a possible origin as a remnant of a forgotten empire's army.A Seven Cities tribe centered in the Karas Hills and Steppes who had an avowed hatred of all who were not Semk.

Structurally these Warrens were divided into two classes: Elder Warrens, which were associated with a particular race; and the Paths, which were those Warrens most commonly accessed by humans and which were derived from K'rul's blood. However, not all realms described as Warrens fit that description; The Abyss was named a Warren but seemed to be used only as a means of travel rather than a source of power. It is also possible that there was a difference on how some Warrens like the Abyss were created.<br><br><i>"The Warrens of Magic dwelt in the beyond. Find the gate and nudge it open a crack. What leaks out is yours to shape. Open yourself to the Warren that comes to you - that finds you. Draw forth its power - as much as your body and soul are capable of containing - but remember, when the body fails, the gate closes."
