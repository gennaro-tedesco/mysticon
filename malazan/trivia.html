        Forkrul Assail Hold. It granted its wielders' voices great magical

        Ascendants were individuals who had transcended death. In the time of
        the First Empire they had been called First Heroes. Ascendants could
        become gods if they gained sufficient following among mortals, but
        they were not gods by default. Those without worshippers were
        considered unchained, or Unaligned in the language of the Deck of
        Dragons. Gods who lost their worshippers remained ascendant, but were
        effectively emasculated unless worship was somehow renewed.<br />

        A Bonecaster is a shaman of the Imass people, and later the T'lan
        Imass. They are practitioners of magic, with T'lan Imass Bonecasters
        specifically utilizing the Warren of Tellann. Historically, they
        played a crucial role in the ritual that transformed the Imass into
        the undead T'lan Imass. Their abilities include 'spiritwalking' to
        perceive visions of the present and future, and sensing the earth to
        locate others or track prey. They are sometimes identified by their
        characteristic lack of weapons.

        and unwavering loyalty. Claws are trained in a variety of skills,
        including espionage, infiltration, and assassination. They operate
        both within the Empire, to root out rebellion and corruption, and
        externally, to advance the Empire's interests. Each Claw undergoes
        intense physical and psychological conditioning, and their hands are
        surgically altered to resemble talons, which they use as deadly
        weapons.

        within them a fragment of his power. They were largely impervious to
        most forms of magic, with chaos being a notable exception. For them,
        magic was 'ambrosia', and if attacked with sorcery they would only
        grow stronger, more immune, and their life-spans - already
        centuries-long - would be even more extended.

        Also known as the Tiste Andii's Fang of Darkness, was a floating

        According to Anomander Rake, the city was home to children, priests,
        and several scholarly warlocks. The fortress sheltered a vast flock of
        Great Ravens that nested in the crags and caverns of its basalt
        surface, and within its inner chambers lay the lair of Silanah, the
        Eleint.<br /><br />It appeared as a vertically-shaped oblong with no
        visible signs of construction on its exterior, apart from a small
        ledge with a recessed doorway leading inside. Tattersail described it
        as an enormous floating mountain, ragged as a blackened tooth and
        battered by time. While stationed above Pale, Moon's Spawn revolved
        steadily until the beginning of the final battle, when the hidden
        portal appeared near the top.<br /><br />Its floating nature rendered
        it immune to siege, and even the undead Logros T'lan Imass were
        unwilling or unable to assault its magical defenses.<br />

        It is not clear if this was due to the Otataral itself or to the lack

        able to regain their powers as long as they were removed from the

        A realm from which mages, priests, shamans, and the like, who might
        use magic, drew their power. Structurally these Warrens were divided
        into two classes: Elder Warrens, which were associated with a
        particular race; and the Paths, which were those Warrens most commonly
        accessed by humans and which were derived from K'rul's blood. However,
        not all realms described as Warrens fit that description; The Abyss
        was named a Warren but seemed to be used only as a means of travel
        rather than a source of power. It is also possible that there was a
        difference on how some Warrens like the Abyss were created.<br /><br /><i>"The Warrens of
          Magic dwelt in the beyond. Find the gate and nudge
          it open a crack. What leaks out is yours to shape. Open yourself to
          the Warren that comes to you - that finds you. Draw forth its power
          - as much as your body and soul are capable of containing - but
          remember, when the body fails, the gate closes." (Tattersail)</i>

        The miasmic paths between the Warrens, turbulent and dangerous
        transitional spaces where the boundaries between magical realms blur
        and dissolve into raw chaos.
