Could shrink to dog-size for concealment and revert to full size during combat.
Barack	Captain serving as Dujek Onearm's young liaison officer to the Black Moranth. His youth is emphasized as a defining characteristic, suggesting he is relatively junior despite his rank.

Gumble	Large talking toad serving as art critic to Ormulogun, the Imperial Artist in Onearm's Host. An immortal, unkillable toad demon whose specific curse is that he is an art critic. Squabbled continually with Ormulogun, each delivering calculated insults in an unending cycle that drove the artist toward madness though he could not stop creating art. Among the Malazan Marines, Ormulogun was sometimes referred to as Gumble's pet. The artist kept a pouch of living but de-winged deerflies at his side to feed his amphibian companion. Accompanied Ormulogun in documenting Onearm's Host during the Pannion War, providing relentless critical commentary on the artist's work intended to record the conquests and campaigns for posterity.
Hareb	Noble-born military officer from Seven Cities, commanding the eleventh company of Onearm's Host during the Pannion War.

Died heroically before the caravan reached Capustan when undead K'Chain Che'Malle K'ell Hunters attacked—six creatures struck the caravan and he perished protecting Gruntle, throwing himself between his captain and an attacker to save his friend's life. Stonny Menackis's bastard son, born from her rape by a Pannion Domin Seerdomin during the Siege of Capustan, was named in his memory.
Haradas	Merchant-mage and caravan master—more accurately, mistress—with the Trygalle Trade Guild. During the Pannion War, led Trygalle Trade Guild caravans to supply the allied armies of High Fist Dujek Onearm and Caladan Brood. After the allies lifted the Siege of Capustan, approached the Bonecaster Silverfox to request permission for the Trygalle Trade Guild to send its caravans through the Warren of Tellann. This T'lan Imass Warren would provide a safer route as it was immune to the poison infecting the other Warrens. Silverfox assented to her request, but was surprised to learn that the Trygalle Guild sorcerers were already capable of accessing Tellann—the Bonecaster claimed that not even the most powerful of the Malazan Empire's mages had accomplished such a feat unaided.

Came to support Tool's skepticism of the Ritual of Tellann after millennia of servitude.
Marble	Sorcerer and priest of Shadow in the city of Capustan, also known as "the Malefic."

At the time of birth, she appeared perhaps middle-aged with a dark round face, though she was actually barely twenty summers old.

Demonstrated extraordinary combat prowess with two short blades that even impressed Onos T'oolan, the legendary First Sword.
Munug	Daru artisan who accompanied Onearm's Host during the Pannion War. His presence among the renegade Malazan forces seemed improbable to High Fist Dujek Onearm, who mused on the unlikeliness of the Bridgeburners running into him as he went to visit the Crippled God—an encounter that appears to have been a significant event during the campaign. Listed in the dramatis personae as a craftsman whose skills and role connected to the broader narrative of the war against the Pannion Domin.
Nakalian	Lancer in the Grey Swords stationed in Capustan who functioned as a spokesperson for his unit.

Ormulogun	Well-regarded artist from Li Heng accompanying the Malaz 5th Army under High Fist Dujek Onearm. Listed in the dramatis personae as artist in Onearm's Host, earning his living by creating brilliant works of art for posterity to accurately record the conquests of the Malazans. Cursed to be accompanied by Gumble, an immortal, unkillable toad demon serving as his art critic. The two squabbled continually, each delivering calculated insults. Among the Malazan Marines, sometimes referred to as Gumble's pet. When Onearm's Host went renegade, felt he had little choice but to continue with his work, partially because it was important to record the rebellious army but also due to the practicalities of finding himself on the wrong continent. Accompanied by Gumble, documented Onearm's Host during the Pannion War. Later prepared three scenes from Dujek's career for the three primary walls of Dujek's barrow: Dujek Onearm standing outside the shattered gates of Black Coral, Dujek Onearm at the parley with Caladan Brood and Anomander Rake, and Dujek Onearm and Tayschrenn outside Pale.

Stonny Menackis|Stonny	Caravan guard from the Daru people who worked alongside Gruntle and Harllo. Described as a beautiful woman with a blunt personality who had a habit of speaking her mind less than tactfully.

He escaped his captors and was found by the Bridgeburner mage Quick Ben while traveling through Hood's Realm, bedraggled and entrapped by wards.

Thurule	Taciturn masked Seguleh warrior, brother of Mok and Senu. Short and lithe, wearing leather armor and gloves while carrying two broadswords. His mask's decoration level indicated his rank—less ornate than Senu's but more than Mok's, placing him between his brothers in the warrior hierarchy.
Twist	Commander of the Black Moranth, holding the rank of Achievant. The Malazan Army bestowed this name upon him because his true Moranth name was completely unpronounceable.
