He is notably connected to Apsalar, whom he possessed and later mentored.<br>
Crippled God|Chained One	The Crippled God, also known as the Chained One, is a foreign god who was summoned to the Malazan world by mages.

D'rek	Also known as the Worm of Autumn, a god of decay, rot, and the changing of seasons. D'rek's gender is fluid, and the deity is strongly opposed to the influence of the Crippled God. Their followers believe that all things, in time, must crumble and return to the earth.<br>

Oponn	The twin Jesters of Chance, Ascendants, and an Unaligned card in the Deck of Dragons. The twins were male and female. When he pushed bad luck followed, while when she pulled, good fortune smiled. Interfering in the lives of mortals was a game they conducted for their own entertainment and a way to disrupt the plans of other Gods. At the same time the tension of their dual nature was part of a never-ending personal game between themselves. The male twin was described as a young man with a thin, pale, expressionless face. He was clothed in loose, white and gold, foppish silk clothing. His slim female counterpart had blonde hair with a reddish tint and wore gaudy silks and a shimmering purple cape.
