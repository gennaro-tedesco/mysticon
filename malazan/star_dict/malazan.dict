His decision to become a renegade stemmed from his ambition and perceived slight when Coltaine was given command of the 7th army over him, as Dom was considered too bloodthirsty to lead.Korel was the Malazan name for the continent to the south and east of Quon Tali. The continent was made up of two subcontinents: the Lands of Fist and Stratem.Tiste Andii night-hunter and blood-kin to Serrat, serving under Rake.The Korvalahrai were a race of demon seafarers from the warren of Aral Gamelon.

Young and with long auburn hair, she was an accomplished rider capable of mastering a warhorse stallion bred of the finest lines of Seven Cities stock.<br> She carried an Otataral longsword which negated sorcery.

The twins were male and female. When he pushed bad luck followed, while when she pulled, good fortune smiled. Interfering in the lives of mortals was a game they conducted for their own entertainment and a way to disrupt the plans of other Gods. At the same time the tension of their dual nature was part of a never-ending personal game between themselves. The male twin was described as a young man with a thin, pale, expressionless face. He was clothed in loose, white and gold, foppish silk clothing.

He wore leather armour over a heavy quilted tunic, thin wool undergarments, leather leggings, and moccasins. His voice took on a strange lilt whenever he struggled against speaking his mind. He had a habit of licking his lips when nervous.<br><br> Whiskeyjack once stated that while Kruppe might have been the most intelligent man alive, Quick Ben was but a short step behind.Quon Tali was the home continent of the Malazan Empire.

Their culture is rich with unique customs, including a distinctive marriage ritual involving braided grass, and they revere a pantheon of nature spirits.Central plain in north Genabackis, home to the nomadic Rhivi people.Ancient pack leader of the Hounds of Shadow, a fierce, scarred hunter whose charges have broken armies and shaken the Warren of Shadow.A Bridgeburner trooper whose recorded role is limited, standing for the countless ordinary soldiers that made the unit’s reputation possible.The Path of the Sea.Close-mouthed captain of the Malazan 14th from Strike Island, survivor of an Azath’s fall and bearer of memories older than empires, able to wear a Stormrider’s form in battle.Soletaken and D’ivers known as the White Jackal; shifts between giant man-jackal and a pack of wolves, notorious predator along the Path of Hands and feared curse of Quon and the Seven Cities hinterlands.The Saemdhi are an indigenous people of the northern tundra, believed to be closely related to the pre-Ritual Imass.

The name 'Seguleh' is an old word for 'The Anvil,' hinting at a possible origin as a remnant of a forgotten empire's army.The Path of the Sky.Second-in-command to Anomander Rake among the Tiste Andii.City on eastern coast of Genabackis.Seven Cities was a sub-continent north of Quon Tali and west of Genabackis that had been conquered by the Malazan Empire. It was an ancient land, built upon the ruins of countless cities dating back to the First Empire. Hot, dry, and largely desert, its sands obscured forgotten pathways, hoarded power, and soaked up sorcery.Sha'ik is the title for the chosen one of the Whirlwind Goddess, also known as the "Hand of Dryjhna" and "Seeress of the Apocalypse." The original Sha'ik was a prophetess and leader of the Whirlwind rebellion in the Holy Desert Raraku. She was a small, dark-haired woman whose appearance reflected her harsh desert life.Shadowkeep serves as the throne site of Shadowthrone within the warren of Shadow. The fortress presents a striking appearance: an enormous lump of black glass, fractured with curving planes, rippled in places, with some corners glistening white as if crushed. The structure combines weathered obsidian with translucent, luminous sections, creating an otherworldly aesthetic. Notably, the keep lacks conventional entrances—visitors pass directly through the stone itself to gain access. Despite its alien exterior, the interior resembles a typical manor house with a sparse corridor leading to a domed chamber housing a simple raised obsidian throne.Also called Ammanas and once the mortal Emperor Kellanved, this Dal Honese mage co-founded the Malazan Empire with Dancer before vanishing into the Deadhouse and staging his own assassination. Ascending to seize the Throne of Shadow, he shares dominion of the Warren with Cotillion, commands its Hounds, and manipulates the High House Shadow and the Deck of Dragons through multilayered plots that reach across continents and elder warrens. His hunched, twitching presence masks encyclopedic knowledge of forgotten paths and an unrelenting drive to outmaneuver rival gods—from opposing the Crippled God to nudging mortal empires from behind the veil.Long, black and sleek Hound of Shadow, swiftest of the pack and often running at Baran's flank.A little-detailed Bridgeburner mentioned in the unit’s roster, with few surviving accounts of his personal history or exploits.Daughter Dusk, Tiste Edur Protectress and Eleint Soletaken, daughter of Scabandari who shifts alliances with her cousins Menandore and Sukul Ankhadu.Draconic Eleint companion to Anomander Rake.Albino Tiste Andii Soletaken whose bone-white dragon form earned him the name White Crow; brother to Anomander Rake and branded “the Betrayer” by the Edur.Nathii settlement and Teblor slave-trade base.Lady of the Simtal Estate in Darujhistan and Turban Orr's lover.Tribal people of the Lamatath Plain.The Skathandi are a tribal people from the Lamatath Plain, with a kingdom that was once a notable power in the region.

Among the Malazan citizenry, he was seen as the Empress' left hand, and as someone who acted behind the scenes to assure the health of the empire.The Teblor are a proud and isolated offshoot of the Thelomen Toblakai, a race of giants. Deliberately sheltered from the outside world, they have developed a seemingly primitive culture, having lost much of their ancestral knowledge. They are significantly larger and stronger than humans, with a fierce warrior tradition. The term 'Teblor' is often used to refer specifically to the tribes from which the famed warrior Karsa Orlong hails, and while related to the broader Toblakai, they are a distinct and formidable people in their own right.The Path of Fire.Tellann is the Elder Warren of the T'lan Imass. Once the Elder Warren of Fire, it was altered by the Ritual of Tellann, which transformed the Imass into the undead T'lan Imass. It is described as not just a source of magic, but also a "time," a place defined by "when" rather than "where." The warren is accessible to the T'lan Imass, allowing them to travel vast distances by turning to dust and riding the winds.The Path of the Land.Distant prophet-tyrant ruling the Pannion Domin, whose holy war looms over Genabackis.Legendary route across Seven Cities for soletaken and D'ivers seeking ascension, converging on the Azath House Tremorlor during the events of Deadhouse Gates.These are the Warrens most easily accessible to human mages and priests, used as a source of power.The Cabal of Darujhistan, a secretive organization of powerful mages and alchemists who protect the city from magical threats and maintain the balance of power.The ancient rulers of Darujhistan who once held absolute power over the city.

Structurally these Warrens were divided into two classes: Elder Warrens, which were associated with a particular race; and the Paths, which were those Warrens most commonly accessed by humans and which were derived from K'rul's blood. However, not all realms described as Warrens fit that description; The Abyss was named a Warren but seemed to be used only as a means of travel rather than a source of power. It is also possible that there was a difference on how some Warrens like the Abyss were created.<br><br><i>"The Warrens of Magic dwelt in the beyond. Find the gate and nudge it open a crack. What leaks out is yours to shape. Open yourself to the Warren that comes to you - that finds you. Draw forth its power - as much as your body and soul are capable of containing - but remember, when the body fails, the gate closes."
