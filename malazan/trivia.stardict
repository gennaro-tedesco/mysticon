Adept	Mostly used to specifically describe those able to interpret the Deck of Dragons.
Adjunct	The Adjunct serves as the Malazan Throne's supreme field commander and voice, empowered to lead Imperial legions, enforce edicts, and depose generals, while their otataral weapon nullifies sorcery around them.
Ahkrast Korvalain	Forkrul Assail Hold. It granted its wielders' voices great magical powers over the psyche. The hold itself was thought to create the ability for thought and consciousness in a world where thought never existed before.
Aral Gamelon	Aral Gamelon (sometimes Aral Gamelain) is the Warren of demonic summoning; most conjurors do not know its true name. It is native to the Galayn and Sirinth races, with the Kenryll’ah said to be highborn of it, and it is death-aspected; the Malazan Empire preferred its demons for campaigns.
Ascendant	Ascendants were individuals who had transcended death. In the time of the First Empire they had been called First Heroes. Ascendants could become gods if they gained sufficient following among mortals, but they were not gods by default. Those without worshippers were considered unchained, or Unaligned in the language of the Deck of Dragons. Gods who lost their worshippers remained ascendant, but were effectively emasculated unless worship was somehow renewed.<br>
Bhederin	Massive shaggy bison native to Genabackis, running in herds that can reach half a million. Bulls are huge and territorial; coats are reddish-brown with humped shoulders and short horns. The Rhivi follow their migrations, walk among and even ride them while also hunting them; cousins of the now-extinct bhed, their pounding hooves keep the plains' thin soil packed.
Bhok'arala	Small, winged creatures native to the deserts of Seven Cities. These monkey-like beings possess remarkably human characteristics, including tiny, human-like hands and faces described as wizened remarkably human. They communicate through various vocalizations—chirping, squawking, and distinctive hooting calls that observers find strangely mournful. Physically, they display mottled tan and brown coloring with distinctive black lips and prominent canines. They primarily inhabit cliff dwellings and sustain themselves by feeding on rhizan. Bhok'arala demonstrate considerable intelligence and social behavior, often appearing in groups and displaying an ability to mimic human actions.
Bloodflies|Bloodfly	Biting insects originating from Seven Cities, named in the Bisbrha and Debrahl languages. These creatures sustain themselves on blood, with their bites causing intense pain and leaving permanent pockmarks. They are most active during daylight hours and disappear as temperatures cool. Protection against bloodflies requires covering one's entire body in mud, though water offers no refuge since the insects can dive into aquatic environments.
Assassins' Guild	Darujhistan's Assassins' Guild was founded almost with the city; nobles often paid it to remove rivals and threats, and the ruling T'orrud Cabal tolerated it because it kept the nobility's vendettas in check. The Guild was run by a master or mistress—called the Master of Assassins—and made up of rival clans, each based in its own "nest."
Azath	Mystical structures that emerge in locations where untamed magic runs wild and poses a threat to life itself. These buildings serve as ultimate prisons designed to indefinitely contain Ascendants and other extraordinarily powerful beings within their grounds while keeping them alive. They required a Guardian or Keeper to be there to greet guests and, in dire cases, protect them. Azath Houses tended to be similar in design, their fronts featuring squat, asymmetrical two-story towers framing a shadowed entrance. People could travel between Warrens in Azath Houses, but very few could open the door from the outside so as to enter the House.
Bonecaster	A Bonecaster is a shaman of the Imass people, and later the T'lan Imass. They are practitioners of magic, with T'lan Imass Bonecasters specifically utilizing the Warren of Tellann. Historically, they played a crucial role in the ritual that transformed the Imass into the undead T'lan Imass. Their abilities include 'spiritwalking' to perceive visions of the present and future, and sensing the earth to locate others or track prey. They are sometimes identified by their characteristic lack of weapons.
Boar Cult	Religious organization dedicated to Fener that flourished within the Malazan Military and Marines during Emperor Kellanved's early reign. Followers observed formal doctrine called Fener's Reve, which included distinctive rituals and hierarchical structures in a primarily male holy order. Empress Laseen crushed the Cult of the Boar, and their presence was subsequently discouraged by the Claw. Notable adherents included the Grey Swords and later military figures like Gesler and Stormy.
Book of Dryjhna|Holy Book	Thousand-year-old Seven Cities holy book of the Whirlwind Goddess whose opening spelled the beginning of the Apocalypse; Sha'ik had been prophesized to open it and lead the Whirlwind rebellion against the Malazan Empire. The book had been in the High Fist's vaults at Aren before it was removed, presumably stolen, by followers of the Apocalypse. It was bound in stained and scarred bhederinhide, its pages lambskin which smelled of lanolin and bloodberry ink.
Chance	A sword dedicated to Oponn, the Twin Jesters of Chance. This weapon embodies the chaotic nature of luck and probability.
Chain of Dogs	The brutal overland evacuation of Malazan refugees across Seven Cities led by Coltaine's 7th Army during the Whirlwind Rebellion.
Capemoths|Capemoth	Grey insects comparable in size to small birds inhabiting arid regions of the Malazan world. These creatures feed on carrion and mostly occur in swarms, particularly across Seven Cities. Their large wings fan slowly whilst eating, and they possess remarkable sensory abilities, detecting movement through air disturbances and perceiving heat signatures from considerable distances. Natural predators of bloodflies, they emerge to feed when the day's heat ends.
Crimson Guard	Famous mercenary company commanded by the deposed Prince K'azz D'Avore, long-time enemies of the Malazan Empire and allies of Caladan Brood on Genabackis. They opposed the Empire on four continents and handed it its first major defeat at Stratem; their sigil was a silver dragon on a red field worn as a brooch on crimson cloaks, they wore blood-red tabards, and their native tongue was Talian.
Claw	The Claw is the elite intelligence and assassination agency of the Malazan Empire, answering directly to the Empress. They are a highly secretive and feared organization, known for their ruthless efficiency and unwavering loyalty. Claws are trained in a variety of skills, including espionage, infiltration, and assassination. They operate both within the Empire, to root out rebellion and corruption, and externally, to advance the Empire's interests. Each Claw undergoes intense physical and psychological conditioning, and their hands are surgically altered to resemble talons, which they use as deadly weapons.
D'ivers	A higher order of shape-shifting that allows an individual to take multiple forms simultaneously, splitting into many separate beings. This is more complex and dangerous than Soletaken transformation.
Deadhouse	An Azath House located in Malaz City's Mouse Quarter, directly across from Coop's Hanged Man Inn. Serves as a portal connecting different worlds, realms, and magical dimensions throughout the Azath network. Was the primary portal used by Emperor Kellanved and Dancer to traverse worlds and warrens.
Deadhouse Warren	A specific section or gateway within the Imperial Warren.
Deck of Dragons|Fatid	The Deck of Dragons, sometimes called the Fatid, was the dominant oracular system across the world (except Lether, which used the Tiles); it could one day be succeeded by the Coins. The Deck comprised cards depicting members of the pantheon, adding new ones as needed, mostly aligned to Houses with a few unaligned cards that could even animate during a reading.<br>
Denaeth Rusen	The Elder Warren, or Hold, of the sea, governed by the ascendant Mael who maintains dominion over its powers. An ancient magical realm predating the newer human Warren system, with a direct relationship to Ruse, the human-accessible Warren of the sea. Mael identified Denaeth Rusen and Ruse as "the warrens where life was first born," suggesting these magical domains serve foundational roles in the creation mythology of the Malazan universe. Notable practitioners include Felash, the fourteenth daughter of Bolkando.
Denul	Denul is the human Warren also known as the Path of Healing. It is described as wild and dangerous, dealing with every aspect of healing across flesh and mind, and forced healing can be traumatic and leave lasting psychological effects.
Dhenrabi	Large marine carnivores usually found in deep water; the name comes from the Seven Cities (Bisbrha and Debrahl) language. Sea serpents that wrap whales and ships, expel air under their armored skins to sink with prey; wide razorlike mouths, deep green segmented armor with long chitinous limbs, up to one hundred and sixty paces.
Dragnipur	A sword wielded by Anomander Rake, forged by the Elder God Draconus. This legendary weapon traps the souls of those it slays within it, chaining them to pull a wagon bearing the Gate of Darkness for eternity.
Drift Avalii	A mysterious and ancient island, believed by some to be a former flying fortress. It is a significant location in the Malazan world, holding many secrets, including the presence of a mysterious 'sleeper' within it. The island is a place of power and is associated with the Throne of Shadow.
D'riss	D'riss, also called the Path of Stone or Path of the Earth, is a human Warren of earth magic. A High Mage of D'riss can petrify objects quickly, and the warren's color is described as magenta.
Durhang	An opiate from Seven Cities. The drug takes the form of a black button that users either smoke or dissolve in tea. Its effects create a pronounced altered state: consumers experience diminished capabilities, chronic ennui, and ravenous hunger. The experience differs between day and night—daytime use produces numbness and dreamlike sensations, while nighttime offers no restorative sleep. Some users enhance the smoke with flavoring agents like wine to improve palatability.
Elder Warrens	These are realms mostly used by some of the older races. Some are also described as Holds.
Enkar'al	Rare, leather-winged reptilian creatures roughly equivalent in size to a horse with sinuous necks, long reptilian heads bristling with fangs, and membranous wings spanning ten paces. Scaly bodies covered in bright yellow or blood-red coloring with a gnarled, shimmering appearance, ridged chests, razor-sharp talons, multiple hearts, and difficult-to-penetrate hides requiring swords or heavy scimitars to damage. Despite poor close-range vision (referenced in the phrase "as blind as an enkar'al"), they detect ground movement from high altitudes and hunt by smell. Classified as "lesser spawn" of Starvald Demelain, originally inhabiting the Seven Cities region, particularly Raraku, where they were considered a delicacy commanding high prices in Pan'potsun markets. The species became nearly extinct east of the Jhag Odhan desert.
Fener	God of war in the form of a giant boar, worshipped by soldiers and tied to the Beast Hold and the warren Tennes. Known for five named tusks and for priesthoods who invoke his power in battle.
Flower	A Malazan ratter: a small, compactly muscled dog with black hair, overlong razor-like canines, and a fox-like snout and ears; the breed was bred for fearless insanity and was called a dubious claim to fame for Malaz City.
Finnest	An object used as a repository of power by a Jaghut. These artifacts contain immense magical energy and can be extremely dangerous if disturbed or misused.
Gathering	The term marked key convocations: the First Gathering of the Imass when Bonecaster Olar Ethil led the Ritual of Tellann 298,665 years before Burn's Sleep to bind them as T'lan Imass; The Barghast Gathering near Capustan where warchief Humbrall Taur summoned the White Face clans—Gilk, Barahn and others—to decide alliance and survival against the Pannion Domin.
Grallin	A figure in a legend Apsalar recounts, called the Lord of the Deep Waters. Grallin’s Sea on the moon bears his name; he lives in underwater gardens and will one day descend to take chosen mortals back to live in peace in his Gardens of the Moon.
Great Ravens|Ravens	The Great Ravens were massive ravens, larger than the norm, who were "born like maggots from the rotting corpse-flesh of the Chained God when he was pulled down into the world". As a result, they carried within them a fragment of his power. They were largely impervious to most forms of magic, with chaos being a notable exception. For them, magic was 'ambrosia', and if attacked with sorcery they would only grow stronger, more immune, and their life-spans - already centuries-long - would be even more extended.
High Fist	The title of a commander of armies in a Malazan Campaign. The High Fist was the highest ranking officer in a theatre of operations. Its naval equivalent rank was an Admiral. A High Fist could only be overruled by the Emperor or Empress him/herself or, by extension, his or her Adjunct.
High Mage	The title of High Mage was used for both military and civilian mages. In the military, it typically referred to the commander of a mage cadre in the Malazan Army. Among civilians, it was used for mages with particularly powerful skills. Some individuals were considered "Natural High Mages" for their talent, even if not officially recognized. The highest rank was the Imperial High Mage, the top-ranking mage in the entire Malazan Army.<br>
Hood's Path	Hood’s Path is the human Warren of Death, controlled by Hood, also called the Paths of the Dead or Path of Death. It is the path of necromancers and demon summoners, tied to death-aspected sorcery.
Hounds of Shadow|Hound of Shadow	Servants of High House Shadow, believed to be more ancient than the Shadow Realm itself. Baran, Blind, Doan, Ganrod, Gear, Rood, and Shan: they are described as large, black, spectral dogs with glowing individually coloured eyes, relentless in their pursuit of prey.<br>
House Shadow	Mutable House in the Deck of Dragons, aligned with Shadowthrone and Cotillion, prowling the liminal paths of Shadow while recruiting wanderers and rogues for motives hidden from gods and mortals alike.
Imperial Warren	A desolate wasteland with with ground consisting of compacted ash, bones, and shattered ruins used by the Empire's mages and Claw assassins to secretly and speedily travel around the world, seen as safer than other warrens because no gods or other creatures had claimed it for themselves.
Irp	A bhok'arala-like familiar of Baruk, knee-high with a wizened face, long arms, and bandy legs; unlike a normal bhok'arala, he spoke Daru.
Jhagra Til	The T'lan Imass name for a now-extinct inland sea formed when Jaghut ice-fields melted roughly three hundred thousand years before the main timeline; it existed briefly, and the silts left behind formed a natural sinkhole that trapped unwary animals.
Jhistal	A high priest who employed human blood in the ritual magic of an Elder God — the Elder Gods' equivalent of a Destriant. Jhistal had once been a name for Mael, the Elder God of the seas; when colonists from the First Empire set forth, they made sacrifices to the salty seas in his name. The Jhistal rituals were so potent they could bind an aspect of Mael in place and force him to answer questions — so awful that even former Malazan Emperor Kellanved found them distasteful.
Kaschan	The Elder Warren of the K'Chain Che'Malle, an ancient sorcerous system that persisted even after the race's apparent extinction. The warren's magic operates through inaudible frequencies: "Kaschan sorcery is born of sounds our ears cannot hear, formed into words that loosen the bindings that hold all matter together." The sorcery manipulates fundamental forces—it bends light and loosens molecular bonds. The K'Chain Che'Malle used this power to construct floating fortresses of stone that rode the sky like clouds. In their final act before extinction, the K'Chain Che'Malle weaponized Kaschan against the invading Tiste races, infecting Kurald Galain with a plague of sorcery that turned Darkness inward and cursing all existence with mortality.
Kenryll'ah|Kenyll'rah	Two distinct but related demon species inhabiting Aral Gamelon and fragments of Kurald Emurlahn, organized in a hierarchical society where Kenryll'ah tyrants ruled over their Kenyll'rah kin for extended periods, growing weak with complacency. The Kenryll'ah tyrants are extremely tall, thin, skeletal beings with skin black as chiseled basalt, sharp facial features, and silver-glinting canines, using knife-like talons as weapons supplemented by double-bladed axes, tulwars, and matlocks. Intelligent creatures who consume fallen enemies, not mindless beasts. The Kenyll'rah peasants stand twice the height of a man with small blue eyes, bestial faces, flattened noses, enormous hands, and thin strangely childlike voices. Workers performing tasks like net-casting, soil-tilling, and herding, though not soldiers by training they can fight when necessary and display philosophical tendencies. Featured in conflicts across multiple Malazan novels, with two demon brothers fighting alongside the Tiste Edur and one serving as proprietor of Smiley's bar.
Kurald Emurlahn	The Elder Warren of Shadow and ancient home of the Tiste Edur, also known as "the Broken Realm" or "the Shattered Warren." The realm was sundered hundreds of thousands of years before the main series when Scabandari Bloodeye caused catastrophic fracturing during internal civil wars where "too many powers, too many betrayals, and too many all-consuming crimes" became unsustainable. When it collapsed, scavengers claimed fragments for private holdings while unclaimed pieces either healed around themselves or simply died. The landscape constantly shifts when unobserved, the night sky maintains slate-grey coloration, and the air feels turgid and warm. Now ruled by Ammanas and Cotillion from Shadowkeep, it contains the Throne of Shadow (which remains unoccupied by accord), native demons, and the Hounds of Shadow as realm guardians. Virtually every permanent structure holds chained prisoners—demons, ascendants, revenants, or wraiths. Shadow possesses a paradoxical nature: it "breaks the rules" by slipping boundaries and respecting no borders, existing simultaneously in multiple locations.
Kurald Galain	The Warren of Darkness and Elder Night, serving as the ancient domain of Mother Dark and the primary realm of the Tiste Andii, including Anomander Rake. Travelers experience it as a lightless, still place with an ambient temperature matching skin warmth. Interestingly, the realm's appearance varies by observer—some perceive darkness while others witness a pearlescent white sky overlooking a rock-strewn vista, suggesting Kurald Galain responds to those who traverse it.
Kurald Liosan	The Elder Warren or Hold of Light, also called Kurald Thyrllan, inhabited by the Tiste Liosan with the city of Saranas as its capital. Born of violence through "the shattering of Darkness," which left it "twisted and fraught, and difficult to enter." Gifted the world with Light and Day, establishing its fundamental role in cosmology. Spawned derivative warrens including Tellann (the T'lan Imass warren) and later Thyr (the human warren), with the human fire warren Telas tracing its roots back through Tellann to Kurald Liosan. Governed by the god Osserc, though he vanished during the Whirlwind Rebellion without the Tiste Liosan's knowledge. The Warren remained difficult to access and heavily guarded, with Liosan warriors emerging to challenge intruders who breached its portals.
Meanas	Meanas, the Path of Shadows and Illusions, is the human Warren of Shadow. It is considered an offshoot of Thyr and Rashan, tied to the Elder Warren of Shadow, and a sister to Mockra; it manipulates perception through light, shadow, and dark, and is not considered a powerful warren unless the mind believes the illusion.
Ragstopper	Dilapidated Malazan trader craft captained by Cartheron Crust; carried the Aren treasury with passengers including Kalam and Salk Elan.
Mezla	A somewhat derogatory Seven Cities term (from Bisbrha and Debrahl languages) for Malazans. The extended form "Mezla'ebdin" translates to "Malazan lapdogs" and was used to describe Seven Cities natives who collaborated with Malazan interests, such as members of the Red Blades military unit.
Mockra	Mockra, the Path of the Mind, is among the rarest warrens accessed by mortals. Its magic subtly manipulates and influences minds through illusion, clouding perception so targets react as if what they sense is real.
Moon's Spawn	Also known as the Tiste Andii's Fang of Darkness, a floating fortress or skykeep containing a city commanded by the Tiste Andii. According to Anomander Rake, the city was home to children, priests, and several scholarly warlocks. The fortress sheltered a vast flock of Great Ravens that nested in the crags and caverns of its basalt surface, and within its inner chambers lay the lair of Silanah, the Eleint.<br>It appeared as a vertically-shaped oblong with no visible signs of construction on its exterior, apart from a small ledge with a recessed doorway leading inside. Its floating nature rendered it immune to siege, and even the undead Logros T'lan Imass were unwilling or unable to assault its magical defenses.<br>
Mother Dark	Elder Goddess worshipped by the Tiste Andii and Queen of High House Dark, whose Warren was the ancient realm of Kurald Galain. She created the world but was lonely; to feel less alone, she brought Father Light into existence — an act her children saw as betrayal. Afterwards the Tiste Andii were either cast out of Kurald Galain or left her embrace by choice, and though Andii mages still used the Warren, they were no longer of it. <br><br><i>"Mother Dark begat three children, the First, Tiste Andii, were her dearest, dwellers of the land before Light. Then were birthed in pain the Second, Tiste Lians, the burning glory of Light itself, and so the First denied their Mother, in their fury, and so were cast out, doomed children of Mother Dark. She then gave rise, in her mercy, to the Third, spawn of the war between Dark and Light, the Tiste Edur, and there was shadow upon their souls."</i>
Omtose Phellack|Phellack	Omtose Phellack is the Jaghut Elder Warren of Ice. It is a frigid, nearly airless domain of jagged blue-green ice. It is said to provide the cold necessary to balance the fire and heat of existence. The T'lan Imass are drawn to its unveiling, and as a result, the warren has been breached many times over the millennia.
Otataral	A rare, reddish ore negating magic traditionally wielded by Imperial Adjuncts. It also prevented mages from accessing or opening their Warrens and prolonged exposure to refined ore could drive them insane. It is not clear if this was due to the Otataral itself or to the lack of access to their Warren. Even after long exposure, mages might be able to regain their powers as long as they were removed from the Otataral source, especially if the Otataral was of low quality.
Quorl	Huge dragonfly-like creature native to Genabackis, often used as a mount by the Tiste Andii. They were domesticated by the Moranth and used as a means of transportation for both goods and people.<br>
Rashan	The Warren of Dark, a Path of sorcery associated with shadow and concealment, commonly worked by Imperial mages such as Tayschrenn. Anathema to Thyr, the human Warren of Light.<br>
Ripath	Malazan Coastal Guard vessel stationed in a village north of Hissar in Seven Cities. Characterized as a low, sleek patrol craft with a single mast, crewed by marines Gesler and Stormy along with several sailors including Truth and Vered.
Rhizan	Small winged reptiles native to Seven Cities, squirrel-sized with retractable wings and mottled ochre-colored skin. These primarily nocturnal hunters feed on small insects like capemoths and bloodflies. During daylight hours they cluster together on shaded surfaces for protection, while serving as prey for larger predators such as bhok'arala.
Ruse	Ruse is the human Warren known as the Path of the Sea, controlled by the Elder God Mael. It is described as the hardest warren to master, with no High Mage of Ruse in the Malazan Empire for at least seven thousand years, and it is related to the Elder Warren Denaeth Rusen, which Mael identified as where life was first born.
Serc	The human Warren known as the Path of the Sky, the warren of Air and Storm, granting practitioners command over atmospheric forces and aerial phenomena. Notable users include Bala Jesselt, the Ascendant Osseric, Quick Ben, and Shell. Mages using Serc can float invisibly and insubstantially along currents of air, endow their bodies with faster physical movement enhancing personal speed and agility, and suffocate opponents in battle by controlling the air around them. Sorrit represents the dragon aspect associated with Serc, connecting this warren to the broader Eleint hierarchy.
Simharal	A term in the Seven Cities (Bisbrha and Debrahl) language to describe a seller of children.
Season of Rot	Ceremony performed by priests of Hood during times of pestilence, most notably conducted in the Imperial capital of Unta. The ritual culminates in the "Thirsting Hour," when priests and acolytes of Hood remove their clothing and anoint themselves with blood from executed murderers before processing through city streets to attract Hood's sprites—swarms of flies that cover their bodies. Citizens typically barricade themselves indoors during the ceremony, sealing windows and burning istaarl leaves to create protective smoke against the supernatural forces unleashed. The Season of Rot serves both religious and social functions, marking periods of plague and death while allowing Hood's priests to perform their sacred rites. A similar ceremony called "Dawn of Flies" occurs in One Eye Cat on Genabackis, where priests cover themselves with honey instead of blood to symbolically represent the same devotion to the Lord of Death.
Silanda	A sleek, black-hulled pre-Imperial Quon dromon with three masts featuring tattered square sails on the main and fore masts, plus a lateen sail on the mizzen. Features twin banks of oars and is constructed from black wood that emanates darkness, with the bulk of its timber from Drift Avalii. Originally a trade ship between the Malazan Empire and the Tiste Andii, the vessel underwent dark magical transformation, infused with sorcery drawn from Kurald Emurlahn, Tellann, Telas, and Toblakai magic. This enchantment creates unusual effects: time suspends aboard the ship, food never spoils, and rats compulsively throw themselves overboard. Crewed by decapitated bodies of its former crew stationed at the oars, with their severed heads kept on deck wrapped in sealskin and controlled by a bone whistle. Serves the Malazan 14th Army.
Soletaken	An order of shape-shifting that allows an individual to take a single alternate form. Unlike D'ivers, Soletaken transform into one creature rather than splitting into multiple beings.
Starvald Demelain	The First Warren, also known as the Warren of T'iam and the Warren of Eleint/Dragons, occupying a unique position as the foundational layer from which all other Warrens sprouted. Described as "the very heart of the Warrens, the heart of K'rul," making it not merely one warren among many, but rather the source from which all others derive. Intrinsically tied to dragons and the entity T'iam, serving as a final resting place for Eleint. The realm presents a desolate environment of black volcanic ash beneath an nearly black sky with three blazing suns that barely penetrate the darkness, carrying "a taint of immeasurable grief that seemed to drain the strength from the body and spirit." Contains various lesser creatures including D'isthal Wyvalla, Enkar'al, Imbrules, Wyval, Luthuras, Purlith bats, Stantars, and Trol.
Tapu	A Seven Cities term originating in the languages of the Bisbrha and Debrahl tribes, referring to a food-hawker or more broadly as a general term for 'street food' or for 'food of the locality'—typically simple, spiced foods served on skewers. The tradition includes specific vendor categories: Tapuharal (roasted goat meat sellers), Tapusepah (unleavened bread sellers), and Taputasr (pastry sellers).
Telas	Telas is the human-accessible Warren known as the Path of Fire. It is said to be the child of the T'lan Imass Hold of Tellann.
Tellann	The Elder Warren of the T'lan Imass. Once the Elder Warren of Fire, it was altered by the Ritual of Tellann, which transformed the Imass into the undead T'lan Imass. It is described as not just a source of magic, but also a "time," a place defined by "when" rather than "where." The warren is accessible to the T'lan Imass, allowing them to travel vast distances by turning to dust and riding the winds.
Tennes	Tennes, the Path of the Land, is a Warren available to human mages. The ancient warren is bound to seasonal cycles and is associated with deities including the boar-god Tennerock (Fener).
Talon	A covert military organization created by Dancer, named after the demon's talons depicted in the Malazan Imperial sigil, functioning as a covert arm for external military campaigns alongside its counterpart, the Claw. The two organizations had distinct roles: the Talon performed external covert military operations, while the Claw was created for assassinations within the Malazan Empire itself. Members carried or wore a talon as identification and maintained seven paces apart when moving as a hand, notably wider spacing than the Claw's formation. After Emperor Kellanved and Dancer's assassination by Surly, the Claw systematically hunted the Talon, initially through sabotaged missions before open warfare erupted. Though believed entirely eliminated, survivors periodically emerged, with newer members often descended from original operatives who inherited knowledge of the true circumstances surrounding their founders' deaths. Notable members include Baudin the Elder, Baudin the Younger, Hawl, Amaron, and Throatslitter.
The Cull|Cull	A systematic purge under Empress Laseen that removed nobles and political opponents from positions of power and sent many to the Otataral Island prison.
The Path of Hands	Mysterious convergence phenomenon drawing Soletaken and D'ivers shapeshifters across Seven Cities toward the Holy Desert Raraku. Manifested visibly through painted inhuman handprints appearing on walls and structures in cities throughout Seven Cities, creating a trail directing shapeshifters toward an unknown destination.
The Paths	These are the Warrens most easily accessible to human mages and priests, used as a source of power.
T'orrud Cabal	A group of mages who were the true rulers of Darujhistan; during the Malazan advance they allied with Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andii against the Empire.
The Tyrant Kings	The ancient rulers of Darujhistan who once held absolute power over the city. Their tyrannical reign ended long ago, but their legacy still haunts the city's history and architecture.
Thyr	Warren of Light, a Path of sorcery of blinding radiance and wards, commonly worked by Imperial battle-mages such as Tattersail. Anathema to Rashan, the human Warren of Dark.<br>
Trygalle Trade Guild	The most effective and most expensive courier service on any continent, renowned for using the Warrens to travel from place to place, saving a great deal of time as the Warrens reduced the amount of time needed to travel great distances. The Guild did not, however, request permission of the Warren residents before travelling through them, and so its caravans were frequently attacked by all manner of creatures and demons — making missions extremely dangerous, and hence expensive. Despite the cost, their services were so highly desired that they did not need to advertise openly. Their High Mages were so powerful that it was said they could access Warrens that not even the Malazan Empire's best mages could enter unaided. Among their most prized possessions was the work of their Surveyants — maps of the Warrens and the connections between them, growing more complete with each trip. Details of their journeys were kept strictly secret as client confidentiality was part of the service.
Tulwar	A curved sword commonly used throughout the Seven Cities subcontinent and by various military forces in the Malazan world. The weapon is characterized by its broad, curved blade similar to a sabre. Tulwars were carried by Seven Cities natives including the Hissar Guard, Red Blades, and Khundryl warriors, as well as by some Malazan marines. The weapon's design reflects the cultural influences of the Seven Cities region.
Warren	A realm from which mages, priests, shamans, and the like drew their power. Structurally these Warrens were divided into two classes: Elder Warrens, associated with a particular race, and the Paths, those Warrens most commonly accessed by humans and which were derived from K'rul's blood. When a mage wished to use magical power, they opened themselves to a Warren by willing into being a portal through which the magical energy flowed. The skills to access the Warrens could be taught, but it was much more common for someone to just be born with the Talent.<br><br><b>The Paths (Human Warrens):</b><br><table border="1" cellpadding="3"><tr><th>Warren</th><th>Aspect</th></tr><tr><td>Aral Gamelon</td><td>Demons</td></tr><tr><td>Denul</td><td>Healing</td></tr><tr><td>D'riss</td><td>Stone</td></tr><tr><td>Hood's Path</td><td>Death</td></tr><tr><td>Meanas</td><td>Shadow and Illusion</td></tr><tr><td>Mockra</td><td>The Mind</td></tr><tr><td>Rashan</td><td>Darkness</td></tr><tr><td>Ruse</td><td>The Sea</td></tr><tr><td>Serc</td><td>The Sky</td></tr><tr><td>Telas</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>Tennes</td><td>The Land</td></tr><tr><td>Thyr</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Fener's Warren</td><td>Borders Chaos</td></tr></table><br><b>Elder Warrens:</b><br><table border="1" cellpadding="3"><tr><th>Warren</th><th>Associated Race</th><th>Aspect</th></tr><tr><td>Ahkrast Korvalain</td><td>Forkrul Assail</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Denaeth Rusen</td><td>Mael</td><td>Seas</td></tr><tr><td>Kaschan</td><td>K'Chain Che'Malle</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Kurald Galain</td><td>Tiste Andii</td><td>Darkness</td></tr><tr><td>Kurald Liosan</td><td>Tiste Liosan</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Kurald Emurlahn</td><td>Tiste Edur</td><td>Shadow (Shattered)</td></tr><tr><td>Omtose Phellack</td><td>Jaghut</td><td>Ice</td></tr><tr><td>Starvald Demelain</td><td>Dragons/Tiam</td><td>Chaos and Dragons</td></tr><tr><td>Tellann</td><td>T'lan Imass</td><td>Fire</td></tr></table><br><b>Other Warrens:</b> The Abyss (travel only), Barghast Warren (forgotten), Chaos (primordial), Imperial Warren, Thelomen Toblakai Warrens.
Warrens of Chaos	The miasmic paths between the Warrens, turbulent and dangerous transitional spaces where the boundaries between magical realms blur and dissolve into raw chaos.
