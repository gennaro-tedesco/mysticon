	<h1>The Warlord Chronicles dictionary</h1>

	<p class="copyright">&copy; 2024 Gennaro Tedesco. All rights reserved. <br /><br />
		This dictionary is based on the characters definitions and references found in each of the three books of the
		Warlord Chronichles trilogy by Bernarn Cornwell and is intended to be a companion look-up for characters, places
		and trivia that the reader will find throughout.<br /><br />
		I have enhanced the entries with citations and small historical additions when deemed appropriate, being however
		careful to avoid disclosing references to characters' deeds that the reader would discover later in the
		books.<br /><br />
