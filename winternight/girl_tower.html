				Carnival in the West). All animal products in the house were eaten before the feast
				began, and during the holiday, people baked round cakes (symbolizing the newborn
				sun) with the last of their butter and oil. Modern-day Maslenitsa lasts a week. In
				The Girl in the Tower, the festival lasts three days. The last day of Maslenitsa is
				called the Day of Forgiveness. Traditionally, if you go on that day to someone you
				have wronged and beg forgiveness, that person has to grant it.</dd>

				<idx:orth>TEREM</idx:orth>
			</dt>
			<dd>The word refers both to the actual location where highborn women lived in Old
				Russia (the upper floors of a home, a separate wing, or even a separate building,
				connected to the men’s part of the palace by a walkway) and more generally to the
				Muscovite practice of secluding aristocratic women. Thought to be derived from the
				Greek teremnon (dwelling) and unrelated to the Arabic word harem. This practice is
				of mysterious origin, owing to a lack of written records from medieval Muscovy. The
				practice of terem reached its height in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
				Peter the Great finally ended the practice and brought women back into the public
				sphere. Functionally, terem meant that highborn Russian women lived lives completely
				separate from men, and girls were brought up in the terem and did not leave it until
				they married. The princess whose father keeps her behind three times nine locks, a
				common trope in Russian fairy tales, is probably derived from this actual practice.

				in the Tower, Sasha has taken his vows of Rassophore but has hesitated to go
				further, because the vows of Stavrophore include a vow of stability of habitation
