His mother begged Fëanor to leave the twins with her when planning the exile to Middle-earth, but he refused, and as she predicted, Amras perished in Middle-earth.

Red-haired, though his hair grew darker than his twin Amras, and more dear to his father. Alike in mood and face with his brother, being twins, which was very rare among the Eldar.

When the Noldor fled from Valinor, she refused to leave Aman even though all her children and her husband departed for Middle-earth. Her refusal was largely due to her friendship with Eärwen wife of Finarfin. She remained in the Blessed Realm while her family crossed the Helcaraxë and endured the wars of Beleriand.

Sent by Círdan as a messenger together with his companion Gelmir, bearing a warning from Ulmo, Lord of Waters, regarding the fate of Nargothrond. Their journey took them first by ship to Drengist seeking the Hidden Kingdom of Turgon, but they found it not. While traveling inland they encountered Tuor seeking the Gate of the Noldor, and aided him by guiding him partway through the great tunnel to Vinyamar. After spying a great mustering of Orcs and evil creatures in the Pass of Sirion, they hastened south to Nargothrond to deliver Ulmo's warning to King Orodreth. The warning was mistrusted and rejected by Túrin, and the messengers were sent away. Nargothrond fell soon after, as Ulmo had foreseen. His name in Sindarin means "Royal Tower."
Arien	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A maiden Maia who served in the gardens of Vána during the days of the Two Trees, watering the golden flowers with dew gathered from Laurelin. A spirit of fire uncorrupted by Melkor, she was chosen by the Valar to guide the vessel of the Sun through the airs of Arda after the destruction of the Two Trees.

Beleg	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Beleg Cúthalion, meaning Strongbow, chief captain of the Sindar and one of the greatest warriors of the First Age. Together with Mablung, he served King Thingol as a captain of the Marchwardens, guarding Doriath's northern borders.

Called Mahal by the Dwarves, whom he created in secret during his impatience for the awakening of the Children of Ilúvatar, fashioning the Seven Fathers and teaching them his craft. When discovered by Eru, he humbly offered his creations to Ilúvatar's will, who accepted them as adopted children and bade them sleep until after the Elves awoke.

Swore the Oath of Fëanor with his brothers and followed them into exile. Ruled in Thargelion in eastern Beleriand. Rescued Haleth and her people the Haladin when they were besieged by Orcs, recognizing the valor of Men, and offered them lands in his domain, though Haleth's pride led her to decline and settle instead in Brethil.

As a craftsman he was second only to Fëanor his grandfather, surpassing in cunning all others who have ever wrought save Fëanor alone. In the Second Age he forged the Rings of Power in Eregion. The greatest rings were his own work, never touched by Sauron: the Three Rings of the Elves named Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the elements of air, fire, and water. When Sauron's treachery was revealed and he forged the One Ring, war came to Eregion. Sauron laid waste to the realm, and Celebrimbor perished in the destruction.

Dwelt in Doriath during the First Age, where he met and wedded Galadriel of the Noldor, who remained in the hidden kingdom for love of him rather than going to Nargothrond with her brother Finrod. Their union brought together the houses of the Sindar and Noldor. Together they ruled the woodland realm of Lothlórien in later ages, becoming Lord and Lady of the Golden Wood. Through his Telerin heritage and kinship to Thingol, he shared the ancient wisdom and long memory of the Elves who first awakened at Cuiviénen.
Celegorm	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>The third son of Fëanor and Nerdanel, a great huntsman who was a friend of the Vala Oromë.

Swore the Oath of Fëanor with his brothers. Ruled in Himlad with his brother Curufin.

Curumo	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Aulë the Smith, from whom he acquired great knowledge of smithing and handiwork.

Daeron	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Chief loremaster and minstrel of King Thingol in Doriath, greatest of all singers and musicians among the Elves east of the Sea, named even before Maglor son of Fëanor. Creator of the Cirth, the runic writing system he devised before the Year of the Trees 1300, which he later expanded into the Angerthas Daeron. The Dwarves who visited Menegroth learned these runes from him and held him in higher esteem than did his own people, carrying the Cirth east over the Blue Mountains where they became widely used. Loved Lúthien Tinúviel, daughter of Thingol, but his love was unrequited. When she fled Doriath, he became lost searching for her and eventually wandered into the east, and his fate thereafter remained unknown to the chroniclers of the West.
Dior	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Half-elven">Half-elven</a><br><br>Dior Eluchíl, meaning Thingol's Heir, son of Beren Erchamion and Lúthien Tinúviel, and first of the Peredhil.

Called Dior Aranel the Beautiful. Wedded Nimloth, a Sindarin maiden of Doriath, and they had three children: twin sons Eluréd and Elurín, and daughter Elwing. After the deaths of Thingol and the departure of Melian, he came to Menegroth with his family and set himself to raise anew the glory of Doriath, becoming its king. When Beren and Lúthien sent him the Silmaril from the Nauglamír before their final passing, he wore it, and its fame spread. The Sons of Fëanor, driven by their Oath, assaulted Menegroth in the Second Kinslaying. Dior and Nimloth were both slain defending their realm, though Elwing escaped with the Silmaril to the Havens of Sirion.
Eärwen	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Teleri">Teleri</a><br><br>The Swan-maiden of Alqualondë, daughter of Olwë, lord of the Teleri in Aman. Wife of Finarfin and mother of Finrod, Angrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel. Her children, being in part Sea-elves through their mother, had a love of the sea and longing for distant places, and it was partly due to this inheritance that all four chose to join the exile to Middle-earth, though Eärwen herself remained in Aman. Because of their Telerin blood through Eärwen, her children were well received in Doriath, the realm of her father's elder brother Thingol. Her name means Sea-maiden.
Egalmoth	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Lord of the House of the Heavenly Arch, one of the twelve houses of Gondolin. Wore a blue mantle embroidered with stars of crystal, and uniquely among the lords of the Noldor carried a bent sword. His house was arrayed in many bright colors, for the heavenly arch they honored was the rainbow, and they were a folk of great wealth. During the Fall of Gondolin, the people of the Arch defended the northern walls alongside the House of the Swallow, pouring rain of arrows upon the hosts of Orcs below. One of only two lords besides Tuor to survive the destruction of the Hidden City, escaping with the refugees through the secret way. Later perished in battle at the Mouths of Sirion.
Eärendil	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Half-elven">Half-elven</a><br><br>Eärendil the Mariner, son of Tuor of the House of Hador and Idril Celebrindal, daughter of Turgon. Born in Gondolin during the First Age, he was both Man and Elf, and through Idril descended from Finwë of the Noldor. Wed Elwing daughter of Dior, who bore him twin sons Elrond and Elros. Became lord of the people at the Havens of Sirion. With the aid of Círdan the Shipwright, he built the ship Vingilótë and sailed seeking Valinor to plead for aid against Morgoth. When Elwing came to him transformed into a white bird bearing the Silmaril upon her breast, its light guided them through the Shadowy Seas to the Blessed Realm. There he came before the Valar as ambassador of both Elves and Men and moved them to pity. The Valar hallowed his ship, set it in the heavens with the Silmaril upon his brow, and he became a living star sailing the firmament. Known as Gil-Estel, the Star of High Hope, his light gave hope to all who beheld it, heralding the coming of the Host of Valinor to overthrow Morgoth.
Ecthelion	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Ecthelion of the Fountain, an Elf-lord of Gondolin and captain of the House of the Fountain, one of the twelve houses of the Gondothlim. Possessed the most beautiful voice and greatest musical talent with the flute among all the people of the hidden city. During the Fall of Gondolin, when Morgoth's forces breached the walls and Balrogs entered the city, he made his stand near the Fountain of the King in the Square of the King. Regaining his strength by drinking from the fountain, he fought with such valor that his defense was remembered in all songs and tales as among the most valiant deeds of the Elder Days. In that final battle he faced Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs and High-captain of Angband. Leaping forward, he stabbed Gothmog with the spike atop his helm, and both fell into the Fountain of the King, where they perished together.
Elenwë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Vanyar">Vanyar</a><br><br>Wife of Turgon and mother of Idril Celebrindal. One of the Vanyar, whose golden hair passed to her daughter. The only known full Vanya who accompanied the Flight of the Noldor and came under the Doom of Mandos. When the Noldor crossed the perilous Helcaraxë after Fëanor departed with the ships, she and Idril fell into the bitter waters. Turgon risked his life to save them but could only save Idril, and Elenwë was covered in fallen ice and lost. She died before reaching Middle-earth, and thus no Vanya is known to have set foot in Middle-earth until the Host of Valinor came in the War of Wrath. Turgon was thereafter always enmitied with the House of Fëanor after losing his wife in the crossing.
Eöl	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Known as the Dark Elf, a great smith who dwelt alone in the forest of Nan Elmoth in East Beleriand. Akin to Thingol, and friend to the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost, from whom he learned much of their craft. Devised galvorn, a black metal of great strength and malleability that he alone knew how to forge, fashioning it into armor that he wore. Forged two great swords from the iron of a fallen meteorite: Anglachel, which he gave as tribute to Thingol and later bore by Beleg and Túrin, and Anguirel which he kept for himself. Using enchantments, he caused Aredhel, sister of Turgon, to become lost in his forest and come to his dwelling. They wed and had a son, Maeglin. When Aredhel fled with Maeglin to Gondolin, Eöl followed them. Brought before Turgon's judgment, in his wrath he threw a poisoned javelin at Maeglin, but Aredhel intercepted it and was mortally wounded. For this kinslaying, Eöl was cast from the cliff of Caragdûr.
Elrond	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Half-elven">Half-elven</a><br><br>Son of Eärendil the Mariner and Elwing the White, twin brother of Elros, and bearer of the Elven-ring Vilya. Born at the Havens of Sirion during the darkest days of the First Age. When only six years old, he and his brother were seized during the Third Kinslaying when the Sons of Fëanor attacked the Havens seeking the Silmaril. Fostered thereafter by Maglor and Maedhros. When the Valar granted the Half-elven the choice of their fate, he chose to be counted among the Elves. Fought with Gil-galad in the War of the Last Alliance against Sauron. After the fall of Eregion, he established the refuge of Imladris, called Rivendell, where he dwelt as Lord and master of that realm through the Second and Third Ages. Father of Arwen Undómiel, and through her his line would continue in the reunited kingdoms of Men. Renowned for his wisdom, healing, and knowledge of ancient lore.
Elros	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Half-elven">Half-elven</a><br><br>Elros Tar-Minyatur, son of Eärendil the Mariner and Elwing, twin brother of Elrond. Born at the Havens of Sirion, and like his brother was caught in the Third Kinslaying and fostered by the Sons of Fëanor. When the Valar granted the Half-elven their choice, he chose to be counted among Men, though the Valar granted him and his descendants a lifespan far beyond that of other mortals. Became the first King of Númenor, taking the royal name Tar-Minyatur in Quenya, meaning High First-ruler, thus establishing the tradition for Númenórean kings to take Quenya throne-names. Founded the realm in the year 32 of the Second Age and ruled for 410 years, remaining unwearied until he was five hundred years old. From him descended the Line of Elros, the Kings and Queens of Númenor, and later the Kings of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-earth.
Elwing	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Half-elven">Half-elven</a><br><br>Elwing the White, daughter of Dior Eluchíl and Nimloth of Doriath, and wife of Eärendil the Mariner. Had two elder twin brothers, Eluréd and Elurín, who were lost in the forest after the Sack of Menegroth. During the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion, when the Sons of Fëanor came to reclaim the Silmaril won by her grandparents Beren and Lúthien, she refused to surrender it. In desperation as the Havens fell, she cast herself into the sea with the Silmaril. Through the power of Ulmo, she was transformed into a great white bird and flew to Eärendil bearing the jewel upon her breast. The Silmaril's light guided them through the Shadowy Seas to Valinor. Mother of twin sons Elrond and Elros. When the Valar offered the Half-elven their choice, she chose to be counted among the Elves, as did Eärendil for her sake. While her husband sails the heavens as a star, she dwells in a tower on the shores of the Sea, and it is said that the sea-birds taught her their language, and she can take their form and fly to meet Eärendil as he returns.
Eönwë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The banner-bearer and herald of Manwë, and chief of the Maiar along with Ilmarë. His might in arms is surpassed by none in Arda, making him the greatest warrior among all the Maiar. When Manwë decided to answer the appeal of Eärendil, he gave his sword to Eönwë and sent him to Middle-earth to lead the Host of the Valar in the War of Wrath. It was Eönwë who overthrew Morgoth in that final battle. After the war, he took the two remaining Silmarils and held them for safekeeping. When Sauron paid obeisance to him and abjured his evil deeds, Eönwë commanded him to return to Aman to receive Manwë's judgment, for he himself had not the power to pardon such a one.
Eru Ilúvatar|Ilúvatar|Eru	Eru Ilúvatar is the transcendent creator who exists eternally in the Timeless Halls beyond the world and bears the Flame Imperishable, the power by which true life is kindled. From his thought he brought forth the Ainur, and to teach them he set before them his theme in the form of music; as they learned to sing together, the Great Music unfolded. Out of that Music he revealed a Vision of the world and its history, and then he spoke the word “Eä,” giving being to the universe itself. Many of the Ainur entered Eä and became the Valar and the Maiar, shaping Arda according to the design shown in the Vision, while Ilúvatar remained beyond the world yet loved it and set its laws and bounds. When discord arose in the Music, he introduced new themes that could not be quenched and declared that no theme can be played that does not have its source in him, so even rebellion would be woven into a greater harmony. He is called Eru, “He that is Alone,” and Ilúvatar, “Father of All,” and the Children of Ilúvatar are the Elves and Men, the Firstborn and the Secondborn. He rarely intervenes directly, but life and fate are ultimately his gift and his design stands above all.
Estë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Gentle, one of the Valier with power to heal all hurts and weariness. Wife of Irmo, dwelling with him in the Gardens of Lórien. Grey is her raiment, and rest is her gift. Her favorite place is an island on the tree-shadowed lake of Lórellin in the Gardens of Lórien, where she sleeps during the day. The Eldar, the Maiar, and even the Valar visit the Gardens to rest and be refreshed by its fountains, receiving healing through her ministrations.
Fëanor	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Eldest and most beloved son of Finwë, High King of the Noldor. Greatest of the Noldor in skill of word and hand, renowned as a craftsman, gem-smith, and warrior. His mother Míriel named him Fëanáro, meaning Spirit of Fire. Created the Silmarils, three jewels that captured the light of the Two Trees of Valinor, his most famous work. After Morgoth slew his father and stole the Silmarils, he swore the terrible Oath that bore his name, binding himself and his seven sons to pursue anyone who withheld the jewels, invoking even Ilúvatar as witness. Led the rebellion of the Noldor and their exile to Middle-earth. The Oath resulted in kinslayings, the Doom of Mandos, and the Fall of the Noldor.
Finarfin	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Third and youngest son of Finwë and his second wife Indis of the Vanyar. Husband of Eärwen daughter of Olwë, and father of Finrod, Angrod, Aegnor, Galadriel, and Orodreth. During the Flight of the Noldor, dismayed by the Doom of Mandos and the tragedy of the Kinslaying of his wife's people at Alqualondë, he turned back to Valinor with a portion of his people. Thereafter he was reckoned King of the Noldor who remained in Aman. Because of his choice, his children and the House of Finarfin were well received in Doriath by Thingol, who was Eärwen's uncle. Led the Valinorean Noldor to Middle-earth in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, though he returned to Valinor afterward.

When the Siege was broken in the Dagor Bragollach, he rode to Angband in wrath and despair and challenged Morgoth to single combat. In that duel he wounded Morgoth seven times with wounds that never fully healed, and dealt one last stab to Morgoth's foot before his death. His body was rescued by Thorondor King of Eagles and brought to a mountaintop overlooking Gondolin, where Turgon built a cairn.
Fingon	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Eldest son of Fingolfin and Anairë, and later second High King of the Noldor. Renowned for his daring rescue of Maedhros, his cousin and friend, from Thangorodrim. Traveling alone and unseen, he climbed the precipices but could not find Maedhros until he sang a song of Valinor in both despair and defiance. Maedhros answered from above in his torment, and Fingon called to Manwë to speed his arrow. Thorondor the King of Eagles swooped down and lifted Fingon up, but to free Maedhros he was forced to cut off his cousin's hand. This deed healed the breach between the Houses of Fingolfin and Fëanor. Ruled as High King from the death of his father in single combat with Morgoth until he was slain by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.

Imprisoned by Sauron with Beren in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, he put forth all his power and burst his bonds to wrestle a werewolf with his bare hands and teeth when it came to kill Beren. He slew the beast but was mortally wounded, dying in the dark and thus redeeming his oath. Fairest and most beloved of the House of Finwë.
Finwë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>First High King of the Noldor and founder of the House of Finwë, from which branched the House of Fëanor, House of Fingolfin, and House of Finarfin.

He was slain, his head crushed with a great mace of iron, becoming the first of the Eldar to be slain in Aman.
Galadriel	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Daughter of Finarfin and Eärwen, and younger sister to Finrod Felagund, Angrod, and Aegnor. Received two names according to Eldar custom: her father named her Artanis meaning Noblewoman, and her mother named her Nerwen. Born in Aman as one of the Noldor, she took part in the Exile following Fëanor's rebellion. Mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in Middle-earth. With her husband Celeborn, she ruled over the woodland realm of Lothlórien in later ages. Her Telerin heritage through her mother Eärwen allowed her to be well received in Doriath by her kinsman Thingol.
Galathil	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>A Sindarin Elf of Doriath, son of Galadhon and grandson of Elmo, brother of King Thingol. Brother to Celeborn, who would become Lord of Lothlórien. Father of Nimloth, who wedded Dior Eluchíl, heir of Thingol. Through his daughter's marriage, Galathil became a distant ancestor of both Elrond and Aragorn, and his blood passed into the lines of Elves and Men. He and his close kin bore names related to trees, as Celeborn's name was devised to mean Silver Tree, and the family honored the tradition of tree-names in memory of the great trees of elder days.
Gelmir	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>A Noldorin Elf, originally one of Angrod's people. After the Dagor Bragollach, he wandered into the southern regions of Beleriand and settled among the folk of Círdan the Shipwright. Later sent by Círdan as a messenger together with his companion Arminas, bearing Ulmo's warning to Nargothrond. During their journey they encountered Tuor at the very Gate of the Noldor, which he sought, and aided him on his path. They brought tidings to King Orodreth of a great mustering of Orcs in the Pass of Sirion, and Ulmo's warning that great peril drew nigh to Nargothrond. The warning was mistrusted by Túrin and rejected, and the messengers were sent away. Nargothrond fell soon thereafter as Ulmo had foreseen. Both he and Arminas were Calaquendi, born in Valinor before the Exile.
Gelmir	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Son of Guilin, a lord of Nargothrond, and elder brother of Gwindor. Captured by the forces of Morgoth during the Dagor Bragollach and held prisoner in Angband for years, where he was tortured and blinded. At the beginning of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Morgoth's forces brought him forth before the assembled host and brutally mutilated him, cutting off his hands and feet before finally slaying him. This atrocity was performed in full view of the armies, intended to provoke them. Seeing his brother's fate, Gwindor broke ranks in fury and charged prematurely across the plains of Anfauglith toward Angband with his company, thus beginning the battle before the appointed signal and dooming the Union of Maedhros to defeat.
Gil-galad	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Fourth and last High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth, who held the kingship throughout the Second Age, far longer than any of his predecessors. After the destruction of Beleriand in the War of Wrath at the beginning of the Second Age, he founded a kingdom in Lindon in the far northwest of Middle-earth and was acknowledged as High King of the Elves of the West. Lived to see the end of the War of the Jewels. Formed the Last Alliance with Elendil and fought Sauron in the War of the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age. Slain in combat with Sauron along with Elendil. Fathered no children, and with his death ended the High Kingship of the Noldor.
Glorfindel	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>A noble Elf-lord of Gondolin and chief of the House of the Golden Flower, one of the mightiest warriors of the Noldor. His house bore the device of a rayed sun upon their shields, and he wore a mantle embroidered with celandines in golden threads, with arms damascened in gold. When Gondolin fell to Morgoth's forces, he led many survivors through the secret way contrived by Idril. At the pass of Cirith Thoronath in the Encircling Mountains, the refugees were ambushed by Orcs and a Balrog. The Eagles came to their aid, but Glorfindel fought the Balrog alone upon a pinnacle of rock in single combat. He dealt the demon a mortal wound, but both fell together into the abyss. Thorondor King of Eagles retrieved his body, and a cairn was raised over him on a mountaintop, covered with grass and yellow flowers. His duel became legendary, and his name was sung in many songs of heroic sacrifice.
Gwindor	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Son of Guilin and brother of Gelmir, an Elf-lord of Nargothrond betrothed to Finduilas, daughter of King Orodreth. Reckoned as a bold leader and the scout who ranged farthest afield of all the folk of Nargothrond. At the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, when he saw his brother Gelmir's mutilated body displayed by the enemy, he charged in fury across the plains of Anfauglith toward Angband's gates with a small company, thus beginning the battle before the signal was given. His company broke through to Angband's very doors, causing Morgoth himself to tremble, but they were ambushed within and all save Gwindor were slain. He endured fourteen years of torment as a thrall in Angband's mines before escaping. Encountered Beleg Cúthalion searching for Túrin, and together they freed Túrin from Orc captivity, though Beleg died in the attempt. Brought Túrin to Nargothrond, where Finduilas grew to love Túrin instead. He counseled against open war with Morgoth, but Túrin's will prevailed. Mortally wounded at the Battle of Tumhalad, with his dying words he charged Túrin to save Finduilas, warning that she alone could save him from his doom.
Guilin	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>A lord of Nargothrond, chief of one of the four kindreds within that realm, and considered among the most noble in name and lineage. Father of two sons: Gelmir and Gwindor, both renowned for their valor and chosen for duties such as commanders of watchtowers and keepers of the highlands. His folk were notable contributors to the building of the deep mansions of Nargothrond, dwelling to its west on the slopes of Taur-en-Faroth, the Hunters' Wold. Lost his elder son Gelmir during the Dagor Bragollach when he was captured by Morgoth's forces. At the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Gelmir was displayed and slain before the host, provoking Gwindor's reckless charge that began the battle prematurely. Hastened forth with great joy upon learning of Gwindor's return after fourteen years, holding him in sweet embrace despite the torments he had endured. Later witnessed the fall of both Gwindor and King Orodreth at the Battle of Tumhalad, and the destruction of Nargothrond soon after.
Gothmog	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>Lord of Balrogs and High-captain of Angband, one of the foremost servants of Morgoth. A corrupted Maia transformed into a demon of fire and shadow, wielding a black axe and whip of flame. At the Dagor-nuin-Giliath he led the Balrogs who surrounded and mortally wounded Fëanor before retreating to Angband. At the Nirnaeth Arnoediad he held the rank of high-captain and slew Fingon, High King of the Noldor, and captured Húrin Thalion alive. His final deed was as marshal of the hosts at the Fall of Gondolin, where he was slain by Ecthelion, who leaped forward and stabbed him with the spike atop his helm. They both fell into the Fountain of the King, where Gothmog drowned with his opponent.
Idril	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Idril Celebrindal, only child of King Turgon of Gondolin and his Vanyarin wife Elenwë. Her mother died during the crossing of the Helcaraxë, and thus did not set foot in Middle-earth. Wife of Tuor and mother of Eärendil the Mariner. Wise and far-seeing, and her heart misgave her with foreboding as a cloud. Therefore she prepared a secret way out of Gondolin, contriving that this work was not known to Maeglin. When the Fall of Gondolin began, she and Tuor used this secret passage to lead many survivors out of the city and save their lives. Gave her son the mother-name Ardamírë, that foretold his destiny. Her union with Tuor was the second union of Elves and Men, after Beren and Lúthien, and from them descended the Half-elven.
Ilmarë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The handmaiden of Varda, Queen of the Stars, and one of the chiefs of the Maiar along with Eönwë. She serves the mightiest of the Valier in Ilmarin atop Taniquetil. Her name may be related to the Quenya words for starlight, being connected to such terms as Ilmen and Ilmarin, the halls where Manwë and Varda dwell.
Ingwë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Vanyar">Vanyar</a><br><br>High King of the Vanyar and High King of all the Elves. First of the Vanyar to travel with Oromë to Valinor, and became king of his people. At first the Vanyar dwelt in Tirion with the Noldor, but they loved the light of the Two Trees and removed to the plains and woods of Valinor and the slopes of Taniquetil. Ingwë dwells upon Taniquetil beneath the halls of Manwë, and never returned or set eyes upon Middle-earth again after the Great Journey. The Vanyar departed from Valinor only once, when they marched to war against Morgoth in the final battle of the First Age.
Irmo|Lórien	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Master of visions and dreams, dwelling in his Gardens in Valinor. With his brother Námo, he is numbered among the Fëanturi, the masters of spirits. More commonly called Lórien after his dwelling place than by his true name Irmo. His gardens lie west of Valimar and contain many types of trees and fumellar, poppies which he uses in his enchantments. Within his realm, a ring of tall shadowy cypress trees surrounds the deep cauldron Silindrin, which holds the collected dew of Telperion set upon a bed of pearls, and while its light remains he can descry many visions of mystery. Husband to Estë the Gentle.
Maedhros	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Eldest of the seven sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel, one of the princes of the Noldor. Swore the Oath of Fëanor with his brothers. After the Noldor returned to Middle-earth, he was captured by Morgoth's treacherous embassy while attempting to negotiate. Morgoth held him captive for thirty years, hanging him by a steel shackle about his right wrist from the face of a precipice of Thangorodrim. His cousin Fingon, aided by Thorondor King of Eagles, rescued him in a daring deed, but was forced to cut off Maedhros's hand to free him from the shackle. Later organized the Union of Maedhros to unite the peoples of Beleriand against Morgoth, though the Union ended in defeat at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.
Maeglin	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Son of Eöl the Dark Elf and Aredhel, sister of Turgon. Born in Nan Elmoth and raised there until he and his mother fled to Gondolin. When they arrived, his father Eöl followed and was captured. Eöl tried to kill Maeglin with a poisoned javelin, but instead slew Aredhel, and for this crime was executed by being thrown from the cliff of Caragdûr. Maeglin became mighty in Gondolin but later, while searching for ore in defiance of Turgon's laws, strayed too far and was captured by Orcs and taken to Angband. Daunted by tortures, he bought his life by betraying Gondolin, motivated also by hatred for Tuor and desire for Idril. During the Fall of Gondolin he laid hands on Idril and Eärendil, but Tuor fought him upon the walls and threw him down to his death, striking the mountain three times before falling into the flames.
Maglor	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Second son of Fëanor and Nerdanel, the greatest minstrel and bard of the Noldor. Renowned for his poetry and singing, and said to have inherited more of his mother's gentler temperament than his brothers. Swore the Oath of Fëanor in Tirion and shared in the woes it bred. Composed the Noldolantë, the lament called The Fall of the Noldor. Ruled the region known as Maglor's Gap. After the War of Wrath, the Silmaril he claimed burned his hand, and in anguish he cast it into the Sea. Last of the oath-takers to survive, he was said to wander the shores of the world, lamenting his pain and loss in song.
Lúthien	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Lúthien Tinúviel, meaning Nightingale, fairest of all the Children of Ilúvatar who have ever lived or shall ever live. Only child of Elu Thingol, King of Doriath, and Melian the Maia, thus the sole offspring of the union between one of the Ainur and one of the Elves. Through her mother she possessed powers greater than any other of the Eldar, including gifts of enchantment, song, and the ability to cast sleep upon even the mightiest. In the woods of Neldoreth she encountered Beren, a mortal Man of the House of Bëor, and they fell in love, becoming the first union of Elf and Man. Together they achieved deeds of legend, including the recovery of a Silmaril from Morgoth's Iron Crown, and their song and dance put even the Dark Lord and his court into slumber. When Beren died, she chose mortality to be with him, and through their union the blood of both Elves and Maiar passed into the lines of Men, from whom descended the Half-elven and the Kings of Númenor.
Mablung	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Mablung of the Heavy Hand, a Sindarin Elf who served King Thingol of Doriath as chief captain and march-warden. His name, meaning "with weighted hand," was likely an epessë rather than his birth name, earned through his prowess in battle. Together with Beleg Cúthalion, he was one of the two great captains of the Sindar. When King Thingol refused involvement in the Union of Maedhros, only Beleg and Mablung among all the warriors of Doriath went forth to fight in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad alongside the other Free Peoples against Morgoth. After Beleg departed to search for Túrin, Mablung became Captain of the Guard of Doriath. He witnessed many of the great deeds and tragedies of the age. Accompanied Thingol on the quest of the wolf Carcharoth to recover the Silmaril from its belly. Fell defending the treasury of Menegroth during the assault by the Dwarves of Nogrod, laying down his life before the place where the Nauglamír was kept.
Mahtan	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>A Noldorin smith of great skill in Valinor, called Urundil meaning Copper-lover for his fondness for that metal. Learned the arts of metalwork and stonecraft under Aulë the Smith in the Blessed Realm, becoming an Aulendur, a Servant of Aulë. Father of Nerdanel, who wed Fëanor. In turn became teacher to Fëanor, instructing him in smithcraft and the working of metals and stones, though he came to regret this when his pupil used this knowledge to forge the first weapons and armor in Aman. Wore a copper circlet upon his head. Unusual among Elves for bearing a beard early in his second cycle of life, when most Eldar could grow beards only from their third cycle onward. His hair was brown with glints of coppery-red, rather than the black typical of most Noldor, and this coloring passed to some of his descendants. Remained loyal to the Valar and did not join the rebellion of the Noldor, staying in Aman when Fëanor led the Exile.
Mandos|Námo	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Doomsman of the Valar, one of the Aratar. His true name is Námo, meaning Judge or Ordainer in Quenya, though he is more commonly called Mandos after his dwelling place. Pronounces judgment in matters of fate at the bidding of Manwë. Keeper of the Houses of the Dead, where he summons the spirits of the slain. Knows and remembers nearly all things that were and shall be, save only those that lie still in the freedom of Ilúvatar. Numbered among the Fëanturi with his brother Irmo, the masters of spirits. Husband to Vairë the Weaver, whose tapestries depicting all events of unfolding history line the ever-widening walls of his Halls. To his realm the fëar of Elves are gathered to await their respective fates, though what becomes of Men after he releases them, the Eldar do not know. Sister to Nienna. Pronounced the Doom of the Noldor after the Kinslaying at Alqualondë.
Manwë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Elder King and greatest of the Aratar, appointed by Eru as Ruler of Arda and vicegerent over all its peoples. Lord of air, wind, and sky, commanding all that flies from the Veil of Arda to the smallest breezes. The birds serve as his messengers, bringing him news from the farthest and deepest places of the world. Dwells upon Taniquetil, highest of mountains, in the halls of Ilmarin with his spouse Varda. Together with her he can see farther than all other eyes, piercing through mist and darkness, and together they hear all voices from every corner of the world. Kind and compassionate ruler, unconcerned with his own power, who best understands the will of Ilúvatar. Wields a sceptre of sapphire made for him by the Noldor. His herald is Eönwë, mightiest of the Maiar in arms.
Melian	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia who dwelt in the Gardens of Lórien in Valinor, tending its trees. Most beautiful, wise, and skilled in songs of enchantment among all the people of Irmo, she also served Vána and Estë. She departed from Valinor for Middle-earth and there encountered Elwë of the Teleri in the forest of Nan Elmoth, where she enchanted him with her song. They wed, and she became Queen of Doriath, the only known Ainu to take one of the Children of Ilúvatar as spouse. She bore a daughter, Lúthien Tinúviel, fairest of all the Children. Weaving great magic and mystery, she shrouded Doriath in the Girdle of Melian, an impenetrable invisible barrier, protecting the realm from Morgoth's forces. Through her daughter's marriage to Beren, her blood of the Maiar passed to both Elves and Men, and her descendants would include Elrond, Arwen, and the Kings of Númenor. After Thingol's death, she departed to Valinor where she mourned in the Halls of Mandos.
Melkor|Morgoth	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Ainur">Ainur</a><br><br>Greatest and most powerful of all the Ainur created by Eru Ilúvatar, though he fell from glory and was cast out from the company of the Valar. In the Music of the Ainur, he wove strange thoughts born of his own imagination into his song, causing discord that warred against the Theme of Ilúvatar itself, and many Ainur attuned their music to his rather than to Eru's design. Publicly rebuked by Eru, who declared that all music finds its source in himself alone, and thus Melkor could neither create his own song nor truly alter the Themes. When he entered Arda he claimed mastery over it, and his power at the beginning was so vast that he stood far beyond all the other Valar combined, capable of singlehandedly besting them at the outset of his rebellion. Corrupted many Ainur to his service, marred Arda, and waged war against the Valar and the Children of Ilúvatar. Later named Morgoth Bauglir, meaning Dark Enemy or Black Foe of the World. Eventually defeated by the Host of Valinor in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age and cast into the Timeless Void beyond the world.
Míriel	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>First wife of Finwë, King of the Noldor, and mother of Fëanor. Her name means Jewel-daughter, and her mother-name was Þerindë or Serindë, meaning the Broideress, for her chief talent was marvelous dexterity of hand in embroidery and needlework. Fëanor had an unusually long gestation, and his birth drew so much of her life energy that afterward she grew weary of living. She departed to the gardens of Lórien, where she voluntarily left her corporeal form. Her fëa went to the Halls of Mandos, where she became handmaid to Vairë the Weaver, fulfilling her craft by weaving historical tapestries telling the deeds of the Noldor.
Nerdanel	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Daughter of Mahtan the smith and wife of Fëanor. A skilled sculptor who made statues so lifelike that people thought them real and tried to speak to them. Known as Nerdanel the Wise, she was strong-willed, free of mind, filled with desire for knowledge, and more patient than her husband. Bore Fëanor seven sons: Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, and Amras, a family size particularly noteworthy among the Eldar who typically have four children or fewer. In the end she became estranged from Fëanor, grieved by his deeds. When he planned to go into exile, she begged him to leave their youngest sons with her, but he refused, and as she predicted, she lost all her children in Middle-earth.
Nessa	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Valier, sister of Oromë and wife of Tulkas. Lithe and fleet of foot, she is swift as an arrow and can outrun the deer who follow her train wherever she goes in the wild. Renowned for her dancing upon the ever-green lawns of Valimar. Her name means "young" in Quenya. Wed Tulkas upon the Isle of Almaren in the Spring of Arda, and danced before the Valar upon the green grass at their wedding feast.
Nienna	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Aratar, the Queen of the Valar most acquainted with grief and mourning. Sister to Mandos and Irmo. Mourns for every wound that Arda has suffered in the marring of Melkor, and so great was her sorrow during the Music of the Ainur that her song turned to lamentation long before its end, weaving mourning into the themes of the World before it began. Does not weep for herself, and those who hearken to her learn pity and endurance in hope. Grey is her raiment. Dwells alone in the west of Valinor, beyond the bounds of the world, and seldom comes to Valimar where mirth and joy prevail, going often instead to the Halls of Mandos which are near to her dwelling. Among those who learned from her was Olórin, to whom she taught pity and patience. Her name contains the Quenya word for "tear."
Nimloth	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>An Elf-maiden of Doriath, daughter of Galathil. In the year 497 of the First Age, she wedded Dior Eluchíl, heir of King Thingol, and for a time they dwelt by the waterfall of Lanthir Lamath at the base of the Blue Mountains. There she bore three children: twin sons Eluréd and Elurín, and a daughter Elwing. After the murder of King Thingol and the departure of Melian from Doriath, she returned with Dior to Menegroth, where he took up the kingship and she became Queen of Doriath. When Beren and Lúthien sent the Silmaril in the Nauglamír to Dior before their final passing, its possession drew the wrath of the Sons of Fëanor. In Yule of the year 506, the Sons of Fëanor assaulted Menegroth in the Second Kinslaying, seeking to reclaim the jewel. Both Dior and Nimloth were slain defending their realm, though their daughter Elwing escaped to the Havens of Sirion bearing the Silmaril with her.
Olórin	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The wisest of the Maiar, a servant to both Manwë and Varda. In his youth he dwelt in Lórien, but his ways often took him to the house of Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. Later he would be sent to Middle-earth as one of the Istari in the Third Age, and alone among that order would remain true to his mission.
Olwë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Teleri">Teleri</a><br><br>Lord of Alqualondë and king of the Teleri in Aman, also known as the Falmari. Younger brother of Elwë, who became Thingol of Doriath. Led the Teleri who completed the Great Journey to Valinor after his brother disappeared in Beleriand. Built Alqualondë, the greatest city of the Teleri on the shores of Aman. Father of Eärwen who wed Finarfin. When Fëanor sought ships to pursue Morgoth to Middle-earth, Olwë rebuked his folly and refused to give him the ships of the Teleri, which they valued as the Noldor did their gems. Fëanor then led his forces to take the ships by force, resulting in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, the first kinslaying among the Eldar. When Thingol learned of the slaying of Olwë's people, he banned the Noldorin language and forbade the Noldor to enter Doriath, save the House of Finarfin whose children were his closest kin through Eärwen.
Orodreth	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Son of Angrod and lord of the Noldor, a dynast of the House of Finarfin. Served as warden of Minas Tirith under his uncle Finrod until the fortress was overrun by Sauron. When Finrod joined Beren in the quest for the Silmaril, he handed rule of Nargothrond to Orodreth. Became King of Nargothrond after Finrod's death. Father of Gil-galad according to later writings, though his parentage was presented differently in the published Silmarillion. Ruled Nargothrond until its fall.
Oromë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Huntsman of the Valar and the Great Rider, one of the Aratar. Hunter of monsters and evil creatures, riding upon his white steed Nahar and blowing his great horn Valaróma, whose sound is like the upgoing of the Sun in scarlet or the sheer lightning cleaving the clouds. Loves horses and hounds, and all trees and forests. In Yavanna's woods in Valinor he trains his folk and beasts for the hunting of the fell creatures of Melkor. Brother of Nessa and husband of Vána the Ever-young. First among the Valar to discover the Elves at their awakening by the waters of Cuiviénen, and he loved the Children of Ilúvatar before they were yet fully born. Called Aldaron, Lord of Forests, and Tauron by the Sindar.
Ossë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia vassal of Ulmo, spirit of the seas who loves the winds and prefers the coasts and isles of Middle-earth to the deeps. Spouse of Uinen. During the early days of Arda, he was seduced and turned to Melkor for a time, and some darkness and violence entered his spirit. He enjoys raging in storms despite the will of Ulmo, and only Uinen can restrain his wild urges. She brought him back to loyalty to Ulmo. The best known of the Maiar to the Elves, he maintained a special friendship with the Teleri, teaching them sea-craft. In the Second Age he raised the island of Númenor from the depths.
Pallando	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Oromë, friend of Alatar who took him along when chosen for the mission to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. The two journeyed together into the far East and South of Middle-earth, where they labored to contest the will of Sauron among the peoples of those lands. Their fate remained largely unknown in the West. In some accounts also called Rómestámo, meaning East-helper.
Pengolodh	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>A loremaster of the Noldor, born in Nevrast to a Sindarin and a Noldorin parent, whose name in Sindarin means "teaching sage" or "doctor of lore." When Turgon built Gondolin, he moved with the people there and became one of its great scholars. Member of the Lambengolmor, the society of linguists and historians of which Rúmil and Fëanor were also members. His Quenya name was Quendingoldo or Quengoldo. Credited with authoring many works that became the basis for later chronicles of the Elder Days, preserving accounts of the ancient history of the Elves and the First Age. Survived the Fall of Gondolin and dwelt in Middle-earth through the Second Age. During the War of the Elves and Sauron, after the fall of Eregion, he departed Middle-earth for Tol Eressëa, last of the Loremasters to leave. In later ages, he accepted Ælfwine the traveler from mortal lands and taught him the lore of the Elves and the history of the Elder Days, thus preserving the ancient knowledge.
Rog	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Lord of the House of the Hammer of Wrath, one of the twelve houses of Gondolin. His house recruited heavily from Noldor who had escaped from Morgoth's mines and nursed a deep hatred for the Dark Enemy and his Balrogs. Great smiths and craftsmen, they revered Aulë above all other Valar. In battle they wielded great maces like hammers and bore heavy shields, for they possessed strong arms. Their device was the Stricken Anvil with a hammer smiting sparks about it, rendered in red, gold, and black iron. During the Fall of Gondolin, his house charged forth and slew a great number of fire-drakes and Balrogs, becoming the first among Elves and Men to slay one of the demons of flame. Seeing no way to retreat, Rog led his warriors outside the city walls where they were surrounded. Every member of the House of the Hammer perished in that last stand, including Rog himself, but their deeds were long remembered in song.
Rúmil	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>A Noldorin sage of Tirion, one of the Lambengolmor, the Loremasters of the Noldor, and the first deviser of written characters among the Elves. In the days of bliss in Valinor, he invented a writing system fitting for recording speech and song, creating letters both for graving upon metal or stone and for drawing with brush or pen. His alphabet was called the Tengwar of Rúmil, or Sarati, meaning "letters," as each character was called a sarat. This system was later expanded and perfected by Fëanor into the Tengwar of Fëanor, more commonly known simply as Tengwar. Very learned in languages, he studied the secret tongue of the Valar through the teaching of Aulë. To him is attributed the authorship of the earliest annals and lore of the Elder Days, including accounts of the Ainulindalë and the early history of Arda. His chronicles preserved the oldest traditions of the creation of the world and the doings of the Valar and Eldar in the ancient days.
Salmar	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of the people of Ulmo who entered Arda with his lord. Maker of the Ulumúri, the great horns of Ulmo wrought of white conch shells. When Ulmo sounds these horns, they produce the music of the sea which echoes in the abyss and can never afterward be forgotten by those who hear it.
Sauron|Mairon	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Aulë the Smith, mightiest of that Vala's people, originally called Mairon meaning "The Admirable" in Quenya. From Aulë he learned much of smithing and handiwork, becoming a great craftsman and mighty in lore. Coveting power through which he would coordinate all things according to his own will, he was ensnared by Melkor in the Spring of Arda and became his spy. He left the Blessed Realm for Middle-earth and bent the knee before Melkor as his greatest and most trusted servant. By the time the Elves awoke, he had command over the stronghold of Angband as Melkor's lieutenant. After Morgoth made his great fortress, he appointed this Maia to be its commander. Later took the name Sauron, and after Morgoth's defeat he did not return for judgment but hid in Middle-earth.
Saeros	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Nandor">Nandor</a><br><br>A counsellor at the court of King Thingol in Doriath, descended from the Guest-elves, those of the Green-elves or Nandor who sought refuge in the hidden kingdom following the death of their lord Denethor in the First Battle of Beleriand. His father Ithilbor was chief of the Guest-elves and held a permanent seat in Thingol's council. In his pride, Saeros begrudged the honor and esteem that King Thingol showed to Túrin Turambar, the mortal who had become the king's foster son, and spoke contemptuously of him and his people. One evening in the halls of Menegroth, his provocations drove Túrin to cast a drinking vessel at his face, wounding him. The next day Saeros attacked Túrin in the forest, but was defeated and humiliated. Fleeing in shame and terror, he attempted to leap across the ravine of the stream Esgalduin but his footing failed on the far side, and he fell back upon a rock in the water and was killed. His death precipitated Túrin's departure from Doriath and set in motion further tragedy.
Thingol|Elwë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Originally called Elwë, one of the two leaders of the Teleri during the Great Journey from Cuiviénen, along with his younger brother Olwë. When the Teleri reached Beleriand, he went wandering in the forest of Nan Elmoth and encountered Melian, one of the Maiar. They fell in love and stood spellbound for years. Alone among the Children of Ilúvatar, he married one of the Ainur. Awakening from the spell, he returned to his people and founded the kingdom of Doriath in the midst of Beleriand. Melian used her power to create the Girdle of Melian, a barrier of bewilderment around the realm. Known thereafter as Elu Thingol in Sindarin, he became High King of the Sindar and nominal Overlord of Beleriand. His subjects became the Grey-elves, speaking Sindarin. Father of Lúthien Tinúviel with Melian. Learned of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë of his brother's people and thereafter banned the Noldorin tongue and forbade the Noldor from entering Doriath, save the House of Finarfin who were his kin through Eärwen.
Tilion	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of the people of Oromë, a young hunter of that Vala's company who bore a silver bow. In the days of the Two Trees he hunted in the forests of Valinor. After the destruction of the Trees, when Telperion yielded one last silver flower, the Valar chose Tilion to guide the vessel of the Moon through the heavens. He was not as strong as Arien who guided the Sun, and he loved her, following her through the night sky. When he occasionally drew too near in his pursuit, his vessel became singed by her heat, and thus the Moon waxes and wanes in its course.
Tulkas	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Champion of Valinor, greatest of the Valar in strength and deeds of prowess. Delights in wrestling and contests of strength, and needs no weapon or steed for he is so strong and swift in combat. His hair and beard are golden, his flesh ruddy, and his laughter ever joyous. Came last to Arda among the Valar, answering the call when Melkor's violence grew too great, and his coming turned the tide of battle. In the Battle of the Powers, after the long siege of Utumno, he wrestled with Melkor and cast him upon his face, binding him in the chain Angainor. Wed Nessa the sister of Oromë upon the Isle of Almaren in the Spring of Arda, in a great feast where she danced before all the Valar. His weapons are his hands, slow to wrath but slow also to forget an injury.
Turgon	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Second son of Fingolfin, younger brother of Fingon and elder brother of Aredhel and Argon, making him second in line to succeed as High King of the Noldor. In Aman he married Elenwë of the Vanyar, and they had a daughter, Idril Celebrindal. During the crossing of the Helcaraxë, Elenwë fell into the bitter waters and was lost, though Turgon saved their daughter. Guided by visions from Ulmo, he discovered the hidden valley of Tumladen and there founded Gondolin, the Hidden City, building it in secret over many years. The city remained concealed from both friend and foe by the Encircling Mountains and guarded by the Eagles of Thorondor. Upon the death of his brother Fingon at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he became High King of the Noldor, the third to bear that title in Middle-earth. He ruled Gondolin for nearly four hundred years, until the city was betrayed by Maeglin and destroyed by Morgoth's forces. He died defending his Tower during the Fall of Gondolin, the last of the great Noldorin realms to endure against the Dark Enemy.
Uinen	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>Lady of the Seas, a Maia of Ulmo and spouse of Ossë. Loves and protects all creatures and weeds that live in the sea, and brings calm to the waters. She alone can restrain the tumultuous waves and wild urges of Ossë, and for this power she is loved by mariners. When Ossë turned to Melkor during the early days of Arda, it was Uinen who brought him back to loyalty to Ulmo. With Ossë, she was among the best known of the Maiar to the Elves.
Ulmo	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Lord of Waters and King of the Sea, one of the Aratar and third in majesty after Manwë and Varda. All waters are under his government, from the great ocean Ekkaia to bays and rivers and even the waters under the earth. His spirit runs in all the veins of the world. Dwells not in Valinor but alone in the Outer Ocean, moving as he will in all the deep waters about the Earth or under the Earth, having no need of any resting place. Before the creation of Arda, when the Ainur sang before Ilúvatar, he was the best singer and maker of music among them. Speaks through the sound of water, and makes music through his great horns the Ulumúri, wrought of white shell. His voice is deep as the deepest of the seas. When he rises from the deeps, he appears dreadful and terrible as a mounting wave that strides to the land, clad in silver-green mail and wearing a helm dark and foam-crested. Loves both Elves and Men and never forsook them, sending messages through waters and dreams even when the Valar withdrew their aid.
Vairë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Weaver, one of the Valier and spouse of Námo who dwells with him in the Halls of Mandos. Weaves all things that have ever been in Time into her storied webs, and the halls that ever widen as the ages pass are clothed with her tapestries depicting all events of unfolding history. The walls of those vast chambers are lined with her work, recording every deed and moment from the beginning of Arda. Her name means "Weaver" or "Ever-weaving" in Quenya, derived from the root meaning "wind" or "weave." Míriel Þerindë entered her service after returning to life, recording the deeds of the House of Finwë in thread and cloth.
Vána	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Ever-young, one of the Valier. Younger sister of Yavanna and spouse of Oromë. Possesses influence over the flora and fauna of Middle-earth. All flowers spring as she passes and open if she glances upon them, and all birds sing at her coming. Dwells in gardens filled with golden flowers, and often comes to the forests of Oromë. The Maia Arien tended the golden flowers of her gardens, watering them with the bright dews from Laurelin in the days of the Two Trees. Melian also served Vána and Estë before departing to Middle-earth. Her name means "beautiful" in Quenya, related to unmarred beauty.
Varda|Elbereth	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Queen of the Valar and Lady of the Stars, one of the Aratar. Wife of Manwë and mightiest of the Valier, dwelling with him upon Taniquetil. Called Elbereth Gilthoniel by the Elves in Sindarin, and Elentári, Star-Queen, in Quenya. Too great is her beauty to be declared in words of Men or Elves, for the light of Ilúvatar lives still in her face, and in light is her power and her joy. Knows all the regions of Eä and rejoices in light. Filled the Two Lamps with radiance during the Spring of Arda. Before the awakening of the Elves, she undertook her greatest work: taking the dew from the vats of Telperion, she created new and brighter stars, setting many individual stars and also constellations, including Carnil, Luinil, Nénar, Lumbar, Alcarinquë, Elemmírë, and the Sickle of the Valar. Together with Manwë she sees beyond all eyes through mist and darkness, and with him hears all voices from every corner of the world. In Middle-earth she is most revered by the Elves, who call upon her name and sing hymns to her. The very mention of her name is said to be deadly to evil spirits. Her name Varda means "Sublime," "Exalted," or "Lofty" in Quenya.
Voronwë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Voronwë Aranwion, called the Steadfast, a mariner of Gondolin and son of Aranwë, a nobleman related to the House of Fingolfin. His mother was one of the Sindar of the Falas, descended from the people of Círdan, thus he had both Noldorin and Sindarin heritage. After the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, King Turgon sent seven ships into the West seeking aid from the Valar, and Voronwë sailed on one of these vessels. All the ships were destroyed in storms, and he alone survived of all the mariners. By the grace of Ulmo, Lord of Waters, he was saved from drowning and cast ashore at Vinyamar in Nevrast, where he encountered Tuor son of Huor. Recognizing that Ulmo's will was at work, Voronwë agreed to guide Tuor through the wastes and perils of Beleriand to the hidden entrance of Gondolin, a journey of great danger. Without his knowledge of the land and his steadfast guidance, Tuor could never have found the Hidden City, and thus he played a crucial role in the salvation of those who escaped the Fall of Gondolin.
Yavanna|Kementári	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Giver of Fruits and Queen of the Earth, one of the Aratar. Called Kementári, meaning Queen of the Earth. Elder sister of Vána and spouse of Aulë, with whom she dwells in central Valinor. Lover of all things that grow in the earth, holding countless forms in her mind, from the trees like towers in forests long ago to the moss upon stones and the small secret things in the mould. All growing things answer to her, both the olvar that are rooted in place and the kelvar that move freely. In reverence she is next to Varda among the Queens of the Valar. Her usual form is that of a tall woman robed in green, though at times she takes other shapes. Some have seen her standing like a tree under heaven, crowned with the Sun and with roots plunging into the waters beneath. From her thoughts came the shapes of the Two Trees of Valinor, Telperion and Laurelin. At her request, Eru gave life to the Ents as shepherds of the trees. Her name means "Giver of Fruits" in Quenya.
