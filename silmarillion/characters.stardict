Aiwendil	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia associated with the Valië Yavanna, the Queen of Earth, possessing a strong affinity for animals and growing things. Chosen by Yavanna, he was later sent to Middle-earth as one of the Istari in the Third Age. His name in the original tongue relates to his connection with nature, and in later ages he became known for his love of beasts and birds above the concerns of Elves and Men.
Alatar	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Oromë the Huntsman, chosen by his lord to be sent to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. Took his friend Pallando with him on this mission. The two journeyed into the far East and South of Middle-earth, and their fate remained largely unknown to the chroniclers of the West. In some accounts also called Morinehtar, meaning Darkness-slayer.
Arien	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A maiden Maia who served in the gardens of Vána during the days of the Two Trees, watering the golden flowers with dew gathered from Laurelin. A spirit of fire uncorrupted by Melkor, she was chosen by the Valar to guide the vessel of the Sun through the airs of Arda after the destruction of the Two Trees. Her light and heat were so great that few could endure to look upon her, and when Tilion who guided the Moon drew too near in his pursuit, his vessel was singed by her radiance.
Aulë|Mahal	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Aratar, the smith and master of crafts among the Valar, and third most powerful among them. Governs the substances of the earth and delights in works of craft, from the smallest to the forging of lands and mountains. Made the rocks, gems, and all minerals of Arda. Called Mahal by the Dwarves, whom he created in secret during his impatience for the awakening of the Children of Ilúvatar, fashioning the Seven Fathers and teaching them his craft. When discovered by Eru, he humbly offered his creations to Ilúvatar's will, who accepted them as adopted children and bade them sleep until after the Elves awoke. Husband to Yavanna, with whom he dwells in central Valinor. Among his pupils were the Maiar Curumo and Mairon, and he taught much of his craft to the Noldor.
Curumo	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Aulë the Smith, from whom he acquired great knowledge of smithing and handiwork. Chosen by Aulë to be sent to Middle-earth as chief of the Istari. His name in Quenya relates to his skill in craft and devices. At Yavanna's request, he took Aiwendil with him on the mission to Middle-earth in the Third Age.
Eönwë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The banner-bearer and herald of Manwë, and chief of the Maiar along with Ilmarë. His might in arms is surpassed by none in Arda, making him the greatest warrior among all the Maiar. When Manwë decided to answer the appeal of Eärendil, he gave his sword to Eönwë and sent him to Middle-earth to lead the Host of the Valar in the War of Wrath. It was Eönwë who overthrew Morgoth in that final battle. After the war, he took the two remaining Silmarils and held them for safekeeping. When Sauron paid obeisance to him and abjured his evil deeds, Eönwë commanded him to return to Aman to receive Manwë's judgment, for he himself had not the power to pardon such a one.
Estë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Gentle, one of the Valier with power to heal all hurts and weariness. Wife of Irmo, dwelling with him in the Gardens of Lórien. Grey is her raiment, and rest is her gift. Her favorite place is an island on the tree-shadowed lake of Lórellin in the Gardens of Lórien, where she sleeps during the day. The Eldar, the Maiar, and even the Valar visit the Gardens to rest and be refreshed by its fountains, receiving healing through her ministrations.
Gothmog	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>Lord of Balrogs and High-captain of Angband, one of the foremost servants of Morgoth. A corrupted Maia transformed into a demon of fire and shadow, wielding a black axe and whip of flame. At the Dagor-nuin-Giliath he led the Balrogs who surrounded and mortally wounded Fëanor before retreating to Angband. At the Nirnaeth Arnoediad he held the rank of high-captain and slew Fingon, High King of the Noldor, and captured Húrin Thalion alive. His final deed was as marshal of the hosts at the Fall of Gondolin, where he was slain by Ecthelion, who leaped forward and stabbed him with the spike atop his helm. They both fell into the Fountain of the King, where Gothmog drowned with his opponent.
Ilmarë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The handmaiden of Varda, Queen of the Stars, and one of the chiefs of the Maiar along with Eönwë. She serves the mightiest of the Valier in Ilmarin atop Taniquetil. Her name may be related to the Quenya words for starlight, being connected to such terms as Ilmen and Ilmarin, the halls where Manwë and Varda dwell.
Irmo|Lórien	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Master of visions and dreams, dwelling in his Gardens in Valinor. With his brother Námo, he is numbered among the Fëanturi, the masters of spirits. More commonly called Lórien after his dwelling place than by his true name Irmo. His gardens lie west of Valimar and contain many types of trees and fumellar, poppies which he uses in his enchantments. Within his realm, a ring of tall shadowy cypress trees surrounds the deep cauldron Silindrin, which holds the collected dew of Telperion set upon a bed of pearls, and while its light remains he can descry many visions of mystery. Husband to Estë the Gentle.
Mandos|Námo	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Doomsman of the Valar, one of the Aratar. His true name is Námo, meaning Judge or Ordainer in Quenya, though he is more commonly called Mandos after his dwelling place. Pronounces judgment in matters of fate at the bidding of Manwë. Keeper of the Houses of the Dead, where he summons the spirits of the slain. Knows and remembers nearly all things that were and shall be, save only those that lie still in the freedom of Ilúvatar. Numbered among the Fëanturi with his brother Irmo, the masters of spirits. Husband to Vairë the Weaver, whose tapestries depicting all events of unfolding history line the ever-widening walls of his Halls. To his realm the fëar of Elves are gathered to await their respective fates, though what becomes of Men after he releases them, the Eldar do not know. Sister to Nienna. Pronounced the Doom of the Noldor after the Kinslaying at Alqualondë.
Manwë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Elder King and greatest of the Aratar, appointed by Eru as Ruler of Arda and vicegerent over all its peoples. Lord of air, wind, and sky, commanding all that flies from the Veil of Arda to the smallest breezes. The birds serve as his messengers, bringing him news from the farthest and deepest places of the world. Dwells upon Taniquetil, highest of mountains, in the halls of Ilmarin with his spouse Varda. Together with her he can see farther than all other eyes, piercing through mist and darkness, and together they hear all voices from every corner of the world. Kind and compassionate ruler, unconcerned with his own power, who best understands the will of Ilúvatar. Wields a sceptre of sapphire made for him by the Noldor. His herald is Eönwë, mightiest of the Maiar in arms.
Melian	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia who dwelt in the Gardens of Lórien in Valinor, tending its trees. Most beautiful, wise, and skilled in songs of enchantment among all the people of Irmo, she also served Vána and Estë. She departed from Valinor for Middle-earth and there encountered Elwë of the Teleri in the forest of Nan Elmoth, where she enchanted him with her song. They wed, and she became Queen of Doriath, the only known Ainu to take one of the Children of Ilúvatar as spouse. She bore a daughter, Lúthien Tinúviel, fairest of all the Children. Weaving great magic and mystery, she shrouded Doriath in the Girdle of Melian, an impenetrable invisible barrier, protecting the realm from Morgoth's forces. Through her daughter's marriage to Beren, her blood of the Maiar passed to both Elves and Men, and her descendants would include Elrond, Arwen, and the Kings of Númenor. After Thingol's death, she departed to Valinor where she mourned in the Halls of Mandos.
Melkor|Morgoth	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Ainur">Ainur</a><br><br>Greatest and most powerful of all the Ainur created by Eru Ilúvatar, though he fell from glory and was cast out from the company of the Valar. In the Music of the Ainur, he wove strange thoughts born of his own imagination into his song, causing discord that warred against the Theme of Ilúvatar itself, and many Ainur attuned their music to his rather than to Eru's design. Publicly rebuked by Eru, who declared that all music finds its source in himself alone, and thus Melkor could neither create his own song nor truly alter the Themes. When he entered Arda he claimed mastery over it, and his power at the beginning was so vast that he stood far beyond all the other Valar combined, capable of singlehandedly besting them at the outset of his rebellion. Corrupted many Ainur to his service, marred Arda, and waged war against the Valar and the Children of Ilúvatar. Later named Morgoth Bauglir, meaning Dark Enemy or Black Foe of the World. Eventually defeated by the Host of Valinor in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age and cast into the Timeless Void beyond the world.
Nessa	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Valier, sister of Oromë and wife of Tulkas. Lithe and fleet of foot, she is swift as an arrow and can outrun the deer who follow her train wherever she goes in the wild. Renowned for her dancing upon the ever-green lawns of Valimar. Her name means "young" in Quenya. Wed Tulkas upon the Isle of Almaren in the Spring of Arda, and danced before the Valar upon the green grass at their wedding feast.
Nienna	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Aratar, the Queen of the Valar most acquainted with grief and mourning. Sister to Mandos and Irmo. Mourns for every wound that Arda has suffered in the marring of Melkor, and so great was her sorrow during the Music of the Ainur that her song turned to lamentation long before its end, weaving mourning into the themes of the World before it began. Does not weep for herself, and those who hearken to her learn pity and endurance in hope. Grey is her raiment. Dwells alone in the west of Valinor, beyond the bounds of the world, and seldom comes to Valimar where mirth and joy prevail, going often instead to the Halls of Mandos which are near to her dwelling. Among those who learned from her was Olórin, to whom she taught pity and patience. Her name contains the Quenya word for "tear."
Olórin	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The wisest of the Maiar, a servant to both Manwë and Varda. In his youth he dwelt in Lórien, but his ways often took him to the house of Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. Later he would be sent to Middle-earth as one of the Istari in the Third Age, and alone among that order would remain true to his mission.
Oromë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Huntsman of the Valar and the Great Rider, one of the Aratar. Hunter of monsters and evil creatures, riding upon his white steed Nahar and blowing his great horn Valaróma, whose sound is like the upgoing of the Sun in scarlet or the sheer lightning cleaving the clouds. Loves horses and hounds, and all trees and forests. In Yavanna's woods in Valinor he trains his folk and beasts for the hunting of the fell creatures of Melkor. Brother of Nessa and husband of Vána the Ever-young. First among the Valar to discover the Elves at their awakening by the waters of Cuiviénen, and he loved the Children of Ilúvatar before they were yet fully born. Called Aldaron, Lord of Forests, and Tauron by the Sindar.
Ossë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia vassal of Ulmo, spirit of the seas who loves the winds and prefers the coasts and isles of Middle-earth to the deeps. Spouse of Uinen. During the early days of Arda, he was seduced and turned to Melkor for a time, and some darkness and violence entered his spirit. He enjoys raging in storms despite the will of Ulmo, and only Uinen can restrain his wild urges. She brought him back to loyalty to Ulmo. The best known of the Maiar to the Elves, he maintained a special friendship with the Teleri, teaching them sea-craft. In the Second Age he raised the island of Númenor from the depths.
Pallando	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Oromë, friend of Alatar who took him along when chosen for the mission to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. The two journeyed together into the far East and South of Middle-earth, where they labored to contest the will of Sauron among the peoples of those lands. Their fate remained largely unknown in the West. In some accounts also called Rómestámo, meaning East-helper.
Salmar	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of the people of Ulmo who entered Arda with his lord. Maker of the Ulumúri, the great horns of Ulmo wrought of white conch shells. When Ulmo sounds these horns, they produce the music of the sea which echoes in the abyss and can never afterward be forgotten by those who hear it.
Sauron|Mairon	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Aulë the Smith, mightiest of that Vala's people, originally called Mairon meaning "The Admirable" in Quenya. From Aulë he learned much of smithing and handiwork, becoming a great craftsman and mighty in lore. Coveting power through which he would coordinate all things according to his own will, he was ensnared by Melkor in the Spring of Arda and became his spy. He left the Blessed Realm for Middle-earth and bent the knee before Melkor as his greatest and most trusted servant. By the time the Elves awoke, he had command over the stronghold of Angband as Melkor's lieutenant. After Morgoth made his great fortress, he appointed this Maia to be its commander. Later took the name Sauron, and after Morgoth's defeat he did not return for judgment but hid in Middle-earth.
Tilion	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of the people of Oromë, a young hunter of that Vala's company who bore a silver bow. In the days of the Two Trees he hunted in the forests of Valinor. After the destruction of the Trees, when Telperion yielded one last silver flower, the Valar chose Tilion to guide the vessel of the Moon through the heavens. He was not as strong as Arien who guided the Sun, and he loved her, following her through the night sky. When he occasionally drew too near in his pursuit, his vessel became singed by her heat, and thus the Moon waxes and wanes in its course.
Tulkas	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Champion of Valinor, greatest of the Valar in strength and deeds of prowess. Delights in wrestling and contests of strength, and needs no weapon or steed for he is so strong and swift in combat. His hair and beard are golden, his flesh ruddy, and his laughter ever joyous. Came last to Arda among the Valar, answering the call when Melkor's violence grew too great, and his coming turned the tide of battle. In the Battle of the Powers, after the long siege of Utumno, he wrestled with Melkor and cast him upon his face, binding him in the chain Angainor. Wed Nessa the sister of Oromë upon the Isle of Almaren in the Spring of Arda, in a great feast where she danced before all the Valar. His weapons are his hands, slow to wrath but slow also to forget an injury.
Uinen	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>Lady of the Seas, a Maia of Ulmo and spouse of Ossë. Loves and protects all creatures and weeds that live in the sea, and brings calm to the waters. She alone can restrain the tumultuous waves and wild urges of Ossë, and for this power she is loved by mariners. When Ossë turned to Melkor during the early days of Arda, it was Uinen who brought him back to loyalty to Ulmo. With Ossë, she was among the best known of the Maiar to the Elves.
Ulmo	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Lord of Waters and King of the Sea, one of the Aratar and third in majesty after Manwë and Varda. All waters are under his government, from the great ocean Ekkaia to bays and rivers and even the waters under the earth. His spirit runs in all the veins of the world. Dwells not in Valinor but alone in the Outer Ocean, moving as he will in all the deep waters about the Earth or under the Earth, having no need of any resting place. Before the creation of Arda, when the Ainur sang before Ilúvatar, he was the best singer and maker of music among them. Speaks through the sound of water, and makes music through his great horns the Ulumúri, wrought of white shell. His voice is deep as the deepest of the seas. When he rises from the deeps, he appears dreadful and terrible as a mounting wave that strides to the land, clad in silver-green mail and wearing a helm dark and foam-crested. Loves both Elves and Men and never forsook them, sending messages through waters and dreams even when the Valar withdrew their aid.
Vairë	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Weaver, one of the Valier and spouse of Námo who dwells with him in the Halls of Mandos. Weaves all things that have ever been in Time into her storied webs, and the halls that ever widen as the ages pass are clothed with her tapestries depicting all events of unfolding history. The walls of those vast chambers are lined with her work, recording every deed and moment from the beginning of Arda. Her name means "Weaver" or "Ever-weaving" in Quenya, derived from the root meaning "wind" or "weave." Míriel Þerindë entered her service after returning to life, recording the deeds of the House of Finwë in thread and cloth.
Vána	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Ever-young, one of the Valier. Younger sister of Yavanna and spouse of Oromë. Possesses influence over the flora and fauna of Middle-earth. All flowers spring as she passes and open if she glances upon them, and all birds sing at her coming. Dwells in gardens filled with golden flowers, and often comes to the forests of Oromë. The Maia Arien tended the golden flowers of her gardens, watering them with the bright dews from Laurelin in the days of the Two Trees. Melian also served Vána and Estë before departing to Middle-earth. Her name means "beautiful" in Quenya, related to unmarred beauty.
Varda|Elbereth	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Queen of the Valar and Lady of the Stars, one of the Aratar. Wife of Manwë and mightiest of the Valier, dwelling with him upon Taniquetil. Called Elbereth Gilthoniel by the Elves in Sindarin, and Elentári, Star-Queen, in Quenya. Too great is her beauty to be declared in words of Men or Elves, for the light of Ilúvatar lives still in her face, and in light is her power and her joy. Knows all the regions of Eä and rejoices in light. Filled the Two Lamps with radiance during the Spring of Arda. Before the awakening of the Elves, she undertook her greatest work: taking the dew from the vats of Telperion, she created new and brighter stars, setting many individual stars and also constellations, including Carnil, Luinil, Nénar, Lumbar, Alcarinquë, Elemmírë, and the Sickle of the Valar. Together with Manwë she sees beyond all eyes through mist and darkness, and with him hears all voices from every corner of the world. In Middle-earth she is most revered by the Elves, who call upon her name and sing hymns to her. The very mention of her name is said to be deadly to evil spirits. Her name Varda means "Sublime," "Exalted," or "Lofty" in Quenya.
Yavanna|Kementári	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Giver of Fruits and Queen of the Earth, one of the Aratar. Called Kementári, meaning Queen of the Earth. Elder sister of Vána and spouse of Aulë, with whom she dwells in central Valinor. Lover of all things that grow in the earth, holding countless forms in her mind, from the trees like towers in forests long ago to the moss upon stones and the small secret things in the mould. All growing things answer to her, both the olvar that are rooted in place and the kelvar that move freely. In reverence she is next to Varda among the Queens of the Valar. Her usual form is that of a tall woman robed in green, though at times she takes other shapes. Some have seen her standing like a tree under heaven, crowned with the Sun and with roots plunging into the waters beneath. From her thoughts came the shapes of the Two Trees of Valinor, Telperion and Laurelin. At her request, Eru gave life to the Ents as shepherds of the trees. Her name means "Giver of Fruits" in Quenya.
