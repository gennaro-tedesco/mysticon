Alqualondë|Swanhaven	A swan-haven of the Falmari on the shores of Aman beside Belegaer, lying between the Calacirya and Araman in northern Eldamar. Built around a natural harbor of rock with a carved entrance, the city was both walled and shaped by the sea. Its quays and mansions were adorned with pearls and mother of pearl from the waters and with jewels received from the Noldor, and it was lit by many lamps so that the haven shone over the sea. The famed swanships of the Teleri were moored there, and the harbor itself was an emblem of their sea craft and love of the waves.
Aman|Blessed Realm|Undying Lands	The western continent of Arda beyond Belegaer, also called the Blessed Realm and the Undying Lands. It contains Valinor, the dwelling place of the Valar, and Eldamar, the Elvish lands of the Amanyar along the coast. The Pelóri mountains were raised along the eastern shore as a defense against Melkor, with Taniquetil as the highest peak, and the Calacirya cleft let the light of Valinor reach Eldamar and Tol Eressëa. Beyond the mountains lay regions such as Araman and Avathar. In the far north, the Helcaraxë once joined the West to Middle-earth by grinding ice, before that bridge was removed and the way to the West was guarded by the seas.
Angband	Melkor's great fortress in the Iron Mountains, a dark stronghold beneath Thangorodrim that became the seat of his power in the First Age. It began as an outlying fortress and armoury to Utumno, but after Utumno was destroyed and Melkor returned to Middle-earth he rebuilt it and raised the towers of Thangorodrim above its gates. The citadel was primarily underground, with deep chambers and vaults hidden beneath the earth, while its visible peaks of ash and slag dominated the northern sky. The Noldor besieged it for centuries until the siege was broken at the Dagor Bragollach, and it was finally destroyed in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age.
Belegaer|Great Sea	The Great Sea, also called the Sundering Seas or Western Sea, lying west of Middle-earth and east of Aman. Before the Second Age it stretched from the Gap of Ilmen in the far north, where the Helcaraxë formed a bridge of ice between Aman and Middle-earth, to far southern waters, with its widest span near the equator and Aman forming its western edge. After the War of Wrath the sea was widened by the drowning of much land, removing the northern ice bridge. In the Downfall of Númenor the world was bent and Aman removed, and only the Straight Road led west to the Undying Lands. Its bays and islands, including the Bay of Balar and Tol Eressëa, shape the maritime geography of the Elder Days.
Beleriand|Valariandë	The north-western region of Middle-earth in the First Age, once a name only for the lands near the Bay of Balar but later applied to the whole land. It lay along the Great Sea with a long western shoreline and was bounded in the east by the Ered Luin, the Blue Mountains. The River Sirion ran north to south and divided West and East Beleriand, while the Andram formed a long wall of hills across its center, and the Gelion with its tributaries drained Ossiriand in the east. Its western rivers Brithon and Nenning flowed through the Falas. In the War of Wrath most of Beleriand was drowned and only a remnant endured as Lindon, leaving its former realms and cities as memory and legend.
Calacirya|Cleft of Light	The pass in the Pelóri north of Taniquetil, with Tirion built upon the hill of Túna within it. It was called the Cleft of Light because the light of the Two Trees came through the gap to illuminate Eldamar, and the rocks of its walls were said to hold many jewels. After the Hiding of Valinor it remained the lone cleft through the mountains, kept open so the Elves could breathe the outer air and see the stars, and so the Vanyar and Noldor would not be wholly separated from the Teleri on the coast. The Quenya name means Light cleft, from elements for light and cleft.
Cuiviénen	A land on the shores of the inland Sea of Helcar in the far east of Middle-earth, the birthplace of the Elves. Ilúvatar awakened the Quendi there in the 1050th Year of the Trees, marking the beginning of the First Age, and from the first they were divided into three kindreds: the Minyar, the Tatyar, and the Nelyar. The Elves dwelt by Cuiviénen for more than fifty Valian Years under the stars before the Valar summoned them westward in the Great Journey. Many answered the summons and became the Eldar, traveling west to Valinor, while those who refused were called the Avari and remained by the starlit waters. The Quenya name means Water of Awakening, from cuivië, awakening, and nen, water, marking it as the most sacred site in Elvish history and the source from which all the kindreds spring.
Doriath|Eglador|The Hidden Kingdom	A mighty forest kingdom of Elu Thingol, the greatest realm of the Sindar in central Beleriand. Its capital was Menegroth, and its lands were a great ring of woods about the River Sirion, including Neldoreth the northern beech forest, Nivrim the west march oaks, and the forests of Region and Radhrim; Brethil and Nan Elmoth were also held though they lay outside the later enchantment. The realm was known as the Guarded Realm and the Hidden Kingdom, for Melian's Girdle protected it and turned aside foes and wanderers. It was a cultural and political heart for the Sindar, long preserved from open war by its guarded borders and the wisdom of its king and queen.
Ezellohar|Corollairë	The green mound at the heart of Valinor, set within the Ring of Doom near Valimar, hallowed by Yavanna and made evergreen. Upon this hill the Two Trees, Telperion and Laurelin, grew, after Yavanna sang upon the grass and Nienna watered it with her tears, and the Valar sat in council to witness the Trees' awakening. Later, Melkor and Ungoliant came to the mound and destroyed the Trees, leaving it darkened and defiled until the winds of Manwë cleared the vapours and Nienna washed the mound. The name means Green Mound, and it also bore the Quenya name Corollairë, Mound of Summer.
Gelion	The principal river of East Beleriand, forming the western boundary of Ossiriand and draining the lands between the Ered Luin and the eastern plains. It arose from two sources, the Little Gelion from Himring and the Greater Gelion from Mount Rerir, then flowed south for many leagues, dividing Estolad from Thargelion before meeting the River Ascar near Sarn Athrad. From there it became the boundary of Ossiriand and was fed by the six other rivers of that land, growing swifter and broader after the falls; dwarves of the Blue Mountains called the lower course Gabilān. Though less wide than Sirion, it ran faster and, after joining Adurant, turned southwest to Belegaer.
Gondolin|Ondolindë	The Hidden City of the Noldor in the vale of Tumladen, north of Beleriand, surrounded by the Encircling Mountains. Turgon founded it after Ulmo guided him to the secret valley, and his people, who had dwelt in Nevrast, moved there in secrecy to become the Gondolindrim. Concealed from friend and foe alike, the city was guarded by the Eagles of Thorondor and endured for nearly four hundred years as the last great Elven realm against Morgoth. Its seclusion, mountain ring, and ordered life made it legendary, until it was discovered through treachery and fell, with a few survivors escaping to the Mouths of Sirion.
Halls of Mandos	A region of Valinor associated with Námo, the Doomsman of the Valar, who is named for his dwelling. The Halls lie westward in Valinor, near the halls of Nienna, and are described as the place to which the dead of Arda are summoned, with the fëar of Elves and Men gathered there and kept apart according to their kind. Vairë the Weaver also dwells there, recording the histories of the world in her tapestries. In Valinor's geography they stand between the far western halls and the more central regions, forming a solemn counterpoint to the Gardens of Lórien and the other blessed lands.
Gardens of Lórien|Lórellin	The fairest of all places in Arda, the gardens of Irmo and Estë in Valinor, filled with silver willows, flowers, and quiet waters. Among its lakes is Lórellin, and the gardens are frequented by spirits who serve the Vala of visions and dreams. Nightingales sang there, and the Eldar, Maiar, and even the Valar came to rest and be refreshed by its fountains. Tilion was said to dream by the pools of Estë beneath the light of Telperion, and Melian sang there when the lights of the Two Trees mingled. Míriel also laid herself down in Lórien and released her fëa, and the name is linked to notions of slumber and dreaming.
Menegroth|Thousand Caves	The Thousand Caves, an underground city of Doriath above the River Esgalduin, home to King Thingol and Queen Melian. It was a cavern town hewn into a rocky hill by the Dwarves of Belegost, with its only entrance by gates high above the river and a stone bridge spanning a deep ravine. Within were vast halls and the Menelrond where Thingol's throne stood. The pillars were shaped like beeches with branches and leaves, the halls were lit by golden lanterns and silver fountains, and the caves held carvings and figurines of animals. It became the most beautiful palace east of the Sea and the royal heart of the Sindar.
Middle-earth|Endor|Ennorath	The central continent of Arda, lying east of Belegaer and west of the Land of the Sun across the East Sea. Most of the history of Arda takes place here, and it is where the Children of Ilúvatar, Elves and Men, came into being along with the Dwarves. In the Elder Days the inland seas of Helcar and Ringil lay to the north and south of its center after the fall of the Two Lamps. The Westlands are the best known portion: their western part, Beleriand, was drowned at the end of the First Age, and survivors relocated to Lindon and Eriador beyond the Blue Mountains. The continent is also called Endor or Ennorath in Elvish tongues.
Máhanaxar|Ring of Doom	A court near Valimar where the Valar held their councils, described as a circle filled with their thrones. It lay outside Valimar's western gates, and within its ring stood the green mound of Ezellohar, where the Two Trees once grew. The Valar sat there to witness Yavanna's song that awakened the Trees, and thereafter they held their great councils bathed in their light. The Ring of Doom is thus a central place of judgment and decision in Valinor, associated with the most momentous choices in the history of Eä. The Quenya name Máhanaxar is tied to the idea of authority and a ring.
Nargothrond	A stronghold built by Finrod Felagund and delved into the banks of the River Narog in West Beleriand. Its deep halls and armouries were carved after the fashion of Menegroth, forming a hidden fortress and royal seat. It became the capital of a realm between the rivers Nenning, Narog, and Teiglin, including Taur-en-Faroth, Talath Dirnen, and Tumhalad, and Finrod was overlord of the Elves of West Beleriand except the Falathrim. Its underground architecture, river setting, and broad realm made it one of the greatest Noldorin centers of power and refuge in the First Age.
Narog	The chief river of West Beleriand and the largest tributary of Sirion, rising from the Pools of Ivrin in the Ered Wethrin. From its source it flowed south and then southeast, passing through a gorge and rapids as it crossed the Andram, before meeting Sirion in Nan tathren not far above the Mouths of Sirion. Its principal tributaries were the Ginglith and the Ringwil, and just south of the Ringwil's inflow the city of Nargothrond was carved into its western bank. The Narog's swift course, rapids, and gorge shaped the landscape of western Beleriand and the defenses of its great Noldorin stronghold.
Númenor|Westernesse|Elenna	A great island kingdom of the Second Age, the realm of the Dúnedain, set in the Great Sea between Middle-earth and Aman. The land was raised from the sea by Ossë as a gift to the Edain, and it was called Elenna, the Starwards, because the Edain were led to it by the Star of Eärendil and because the island was shaped like a five-pointed star. Its promontories were Forostar, Andustar, Hyarnustar, Hyarrostar, and Orrostar, with the central region of Mittalmar and the holy mountain Meneltarma at its heart. Númenor had only two rivers, Siril and Nunduinë, and its chief city was Armenelos, alongside ports such as Andúnië and Rómenna.
Ossiriand	A wooded region of eastern Beleriand between the Ered Luin and the River Gelion, bounded by Ascar to the north and Adurant to the south, named for the seven rivers that watered it. It was settled by the Nandor under Denethor, who became known as the Green elves, skilled in woodcraft and secrecy; the Noldor called the land Lindon, the Land of Music, for the singing heard across the Gelion. Elm trees were plentiful, and the region remained lightly peopled and largely untouched by the great wars, later surviving the War of Wrath as the remnant land known afterward as Lindon.
Pelóri|Mountains of Aman|Mountains of Defence	The great mountain fence of Aman, raised by the Valar after the destruction of Almaren to defend their new realm against Melkor. The range forms the eastern wall of Valinor, with the Light of the Two Trees shining behind it while the narrow shores at its eastern feet lay in shadow. The tallest peak is Taniquetil, where the mansions of Manwë and Varda stand; the second highest is Hyarmentir above Avathar. The Valar later cut the Calacirya through the mountains so the Light could reach Eldamar and Tol Eressëa, and the mountains were raised higher during the Nurtalé Valinóreva.
Sirion	The principal river of Beleriand, running from the Eithel Sirion beneath the Ered Wethrin southward to the Bay of Balar, and for much of its length forming the border between East and West Beleriand. From its source it passed through the Fen of Serech and the narrow Pass of Sirion between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath, then continued south past Brethil and Doriath before plunging underground at the Falls of Sirion in the Andram and emerging at the Gates of Sirion. It flowed through Nan tathren to its mouths, receiving many tributaries including the Taeglin, Esgalduin, Aros, and Narog. The river's crossings and islands, such as Tol Sirion, were strategic points in the wars of the First Age.
Taeglin|Teiglin	A tributary of Sirion, rising in the Ered Wethrin and flowing southeast through Brethil before joining Sirion on the borders of Doriath. In its upper course it ran through the Ravines of Taeglin along the forest's edge, and farther south it could be forded at the Crossings of Taeglin. A road ran through the valley from Nargothrond toward Minas Tirith, making it a route of travel and war. The name reflects a sense of boundary, and earlier writings used the form Teiglin before the later spelling Taeglin was adopted.
Taniquetil|Oiolossë|Amon Uilos	The highest peak of the Pelóri and the tallest mountain in Arda, a holy mountain in central Aman. On its summit stood Ilmarin, the mansions of Manwë and Varda, from which they looked out over the world. The mountain bore many names, including Oiolossë, Ever snow white, and Amon Uilos, White Mountain, and its Quenya name is glossed as High White Peak or High snow peak. It was raised in Aman in the Valian Years and became a symbol of the West's majesty and the seat of the highest authority among the Valar.
Tirion|Tirion upon Túna|Tirion the Fair	The city of the Eldar in Eldamar, built on the green hill of Túna within the Calacirya, the only pass through the Pelóri. Its white walls and terraces crowned the hill, and its streets were said to be strewn with white sand like grains of diamond, with crystal stairs rising to its gates. The city was dominated by Ingwë's tower, the Mindon Eldaliéva, whose light shone far out to sea, and by the Great Square where the white tree Galathilion grew. It was ruled first by Ingwë and later by Finwë, and it became the greatest Elvish city of Aman, a symbol of Eldarin craft and memory.
Tol Eressëa|Lonely Island	The Lonely Island off the coast of Valinor in the Bay of Eldamar, surrounded by the Enchanted Isles, an arrowhead-shaped green land whose name reflects its original isolation in the midst of Belegaer. Ulmo moved it back and forth across the sea to ferry the Elves to Aman, and afterward it was anchored just off Aman's eastern shore. The island became the dwelling of the Teleri of Aman, and later a home for many Eldar who returned from Middle-earth at the end of the First Age. Its principal city is Avallónë on the eastern shore, and light from the Calacirya made its lands fertile and fair, with the West visible beyond the sea.
Utumno|Udûn	Melkor's first and greatest fortress, built after his arrival in Arda beneath the Iron Mountains where the light of the Two Lamps was dim and cold. From this stronghold the blight of his hatred spread and the Spring of Arda was marred. It was delved exceedingly deep, with pits of fire, caverns, and vaults hidden with deceit, and it housed great hosts of servants; the far north became desolate under its shadow. It served as Melkor's base until the Valar assailed it, broke its gates, and unroofed it, taking Melkor captive to Valinor. Angband began as a lesser fortress to the west of Utumno and later became its successor.
Valimar|Valmar	The City of Many Bells at the heart of Valinor, where many of the Valar and Maiar dwelt. It lay near Ezellohar, the green mound where the Two Trees grew, on the Girdle of Arda in the east-central Plains of Valinor, west of Taniquetil. The city is described as a place of splendor, with houses roofed in gold, floors of silver, and doors of polished bronze, their stones lifted with spells and bound with magic. Its name means the dwelling of the Valar, emphasizing its role as the central habitation of the Powers in the Blessed Realm.
Valinor|Valinórë	The realm of the Valar in central Aman, established after Almaren was destroyed and properly referring to the inhabited lands of the continent. It was home to the Valar and to the Vanyar, Noldor, and some of the Teleri, with Valimar as its central city and Tol Eressëa lying just off its eastern shore. The Pelóri were raised to the east as a defense against Melkor, while Ekkaia lay to the west, and the land was hallowed and stainless, free from sickness or decay. The Two Trees grew on Ezellohar and lit the realm, and the great Elvish cities of Tirion and Alqualondë were built there.
