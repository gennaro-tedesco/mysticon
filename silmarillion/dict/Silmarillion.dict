Immortal angelic spirits created by Eru Ilúvatar before the beginning of the World, whose being originated in the Timeless Halls beyond creation. Through the Music of the Ainur, they participated in the vision and shaping of Arda. Those who chose to enter the physical world to complete its material development became known as the Powers of Arda, divided into the mightier Valar and the lesser Maiar. As beings of free will, they could rebel against their creator, as demonstrated by Melkor's fall into darkness.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia associated with the Valië Yavanna, the Queen of Earth, possessing a strong affinity for animals and growing things. Chosen by Yavanna, he was later sent to Middle-earth as one of the Istari in the Third Age. His name in the original tongue relates to his connection with nature, and in later ages he became known for his love of beasts and birds above the concerns of Elves and Men.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Oromë the Huntsman, chosen by his lord to be sent to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. Took his friend Pallando with him on this mission. The two journeyed into the far East and South of Middle-earth, and their fate remained largely unknown to the chroniclers of the West. In some accounts also called Morinehtar, meaning Darkness-slayer.Those of Aman, a term used by the Noldorin Exiles to describe themselves and those Elves who dwelt in the Blessed Realm of Valinor. The distinction arose after the Flight of the Noldor, when terminology shifted from the older Calaquendi/Moriquendi classification to the more geographically-based Amanyar/Úmanyar division, which proved less offensive to the Sindar who had never seen the Light of the Two Trees.The Exalted or High Ones of Arda, comprising the eight greatest among the Valar: Manwë, Varda, Ulmo, Yavanna, Aulë, Mandos, Nienna, and Oromë. These mightiest of the Powers possessed supreme authority and influence over the shaping and governance of Arda, standing above their peers in majesty and power.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A maiden Maia who served in the gardens of Vána during the days of the Two Trees, watering the golden flowers with dew gathered from Laurelin. A spirit of fire uncorrupted by Melkor, she was chosen by the Valar to guide the vessel of the Sun through the airs of Arda after the destruction of the Two Trees. Her light and heat were so great that few could endure to look upon her, and when Tilion who guided the Moon drew too near in his pursuit, his vessel was singed by her radiance.The Secondborn, the race of mortal Men who awoke in Middle-earth when the Sun first rose in the heavens late in the First Age, millennia after the awakening of the Elves. Unlike the immortal Firstborn, they were granted the gift of mortality and freedom from the circles of the world, though this gift was often perceived as a doom by those who did not understand Eru's design.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Aratar, the smith and master of crafts among the Valar, and third most powerful among them. Governs the substances of the earth and delights in works of craft, from the smallest to the forging of lands and mountains. Made the rocks, gems, and all minerals of Arda. Called Mahal by the Dwarves, whom he created in secret during his impatience for the awakening of the Children of Ilúvatar, fashioning the Seven Fathers and teaching them his craft. When discovered by Eru, he humbly offered his creations to Ilúvatar's will, who accepted them as adopted children and bade them sleep until after the Elves awoke. Husband to Yavanna, with whom he dwells in central Valinor. Among his pupils were the Maiar Curumo and Mairon, and he taught much of his craft to the Noldor.The Refusers or Unwilling, those Quendi who rejected the summons of the Valar and refused to undertake the Great Journey to Valinor. Their initial population included more than one-third of all Elves, evenly divided between the Tatyar and Nelyar kindreds. After their refusal, they fragmented into many separate kindreds with different languages as they spread across Middle-earth, remaining largely outside the histories preserved by the Eldar.Corrupted Maiar who followed Melkor in his rebellion and were transformed into demons of terror and flame. These powerful spirits of fire and shadow served as Morgoth's most terrible servants, dwelling in the depths of Angband and leading his armies in battle. Their true nature as fallen Ainur made them formidable adversaries even to the mightiest of the Children of Ilúvatar.Elves of Light, comprising the Vanyar, Noldor, and those Teleri who completed the Great Journey and beheld the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor in the Blessed Realm. This term distinguished them from the Moriquendi who never saw that sacred light. After the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, the Exiles found this terminology offensive to the Sindar and largely ceased its use except in written lore, preferring the terms Amanyar and Úmanyar instead.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Aulë the Smith, from whom he acquired great knowledge of smithing and handiwork. Chosen by Aulë to be sent to Middle-earth as chief of the Istari. His name in Quenya relates to his skill in craft and devices. At Yavanna's request, he took Aiwendil with him on the mission to Middle-earth in the Third Age.Ancient creatures of fire and malice, first brought forth by Morgoth in Angband as weapons of war and terror. Glaurung, Father of Dragons, was the first of the Fire-drakes, combining immense physical power with cunning intelligence and the ability to enchant and deceive through speech and gaze. These serpents of flame became instruments of destruction in the wars of Beleriand.The children of Aulë the Smith, created by the Vala in his impatience for the awakening of the Children of Ilúvatar, though Eru granted them true life and independent will. Makers and craftsmen of great skill, they were given their own language Khuzdul by their creator. Seven fathers of the Dwarves were made, each founding a great house of their kindred, and they proved themselves steadfast and enduring despite not being among the original designs of Eru.Great Eagles or Eagles of Manwë, immense sentient birds who served as messengers and agents of the Lord of the Winds. Capable of speech and possessed of keen intelligence, these noble creatures aided the Free Peoples in their struggles against the forces of darkness. Led by mighty lords such as Thorondor, they dwelt in the high places of the world and intervened at crucial moments in the wars against Morgoth and his servants.The Elf-friends, specifically those Houses of Men who allied with the Elves during the First Age in Beleriand and fought against Morgoth. Distinguished from other Men by their friendship with the Eldar and their valor in the wars of the Silmarils, they were granted the island realm of Númenor as a reward for their faithfulness. The term particularly applies to the Three Houses who first entered Beleriand and their descendants.The Forsaken, a group of Teleri who remained behind in the coastal regions of Middle-earth to search for their lord Thingol, who had disappeared near the end of the Great Journey. These Elves missed their chance to cross the sea to Valinor when the island ferry departed without them, and they became part of the Sindar of Beleriand, dwelling in the lands that would become the realm of Doriath.Those Elves who accepted the summons of the Valar and began the Great Journey from Cuiviénen to Aman, even if they did not complete it. The name means "People of the Stars" and distinguishes them from the Avari who refused the call. The three kindreds of the Eldar were the Vanyar, Noldor, and Teleri, descending from the original three tribes of Minyar, Tatyar, and Nelyar.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Quendi">Quendi</a><br><br>The Firstborn children of Ilúvatar, who awoke at Cuiviénen under the stars. Called Quendi, "The Speakers," for they were the first to use spoken language. Immortal and bound to Arda, they divided into many kindreds through the choices they made in response to the summons of the Valar.<br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="5"><tr><th colspan="3">Classification of the Elven Kindreds</th></tr><tr><th>By Journey</th><th>By Light</th><th>By Dwelling</th></tr><tr><td><b>Eldar</b> - Those who answered the summons</td><td><b>Calaquendi</b> - Elves of Light (saw the Two Trees)</td><td><b>Amanyar</b> - Those of Aman</td></tr><tr><td><b>Avari</b> - Those who refused the summons</td><td><b>Moriquendi</b> - Elves of Darkness (never saw the Two Trees)</td><td><b>Úmanyar</b> - Those not of Aman</td></tr><tr><th colspan="3">The Three Kindreds of the Eldar</th></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Vanyar</b> (from Minyar) - The Fair Elves, first to reach Aman</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Noldor</b> (from Tatyar) - The Deep Elves, masters of craft and lore</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Teleri</b> (from Nelyar) - The third kindred, most numerous and divided:<ul><li><b>Falmari</b> - Sea-elves who reached Aman</li><li><b>Sindar</b> - Grey-elves of Beleriand (includes <b>Eglath</b>, <b>Falathrim</b>, <b>Mithrim</b>)</li><li><b>Nandor</b> - Those who turned back at the Misty Mountains (includes <b>Laiquendi</b>)</li></ul></td></tr></table>Ancient shepherds of the trees, placed upon Middle-earth by the will of Yavanna the Giver of Fruits in response to her concerns about the fate of growing things. These tree-like beings possessed great strength and longevity, dwelling in forests and protecting the olvar from harm. They were granted life and consciousness to serve as guardians of all that grows, though they moved slowly and spoke in a language as deep and long as the roots of mountains.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Gentle, one of the Valier with power to heal all hurts and weariness. Wife of Irmo, dwelling with him in the Gardens of Lórien. Grey is her raiment, and rest is her gift. Her favorite place is an island on the tree-shadowed lake of Lórellin in the Gardens of Lórien, where she sleeps during the day. The Eldar, the Maiar, and even the Valar visit the Gardens to rest and be refreshed by its fountains, receiving healing through her ministrations.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The banner-bearer and herald of Manwë, and chief of the Maiar along with Ilmarë. His might in arms is surpassed by none in Arda, making him the greatest warrior among all the Maiar. When Manwë decided to answer the appeal of Eärendil, he gave his sword to Eönwë and sent him to Middle-earth to lead the Host of the Valar in the War of Wrath. It was Eönwë who overthrew Morgoth in that final battle. After the war, he took the two remaining Silmarils and held them for safekeeping. When Sauron paid obeisance to him and abjured his evil deeds, Eönwë commanded him to return to Aman to receive Manwë's judgment, for he himself had not the power to pardon such a one.The coastal Sindar who dwelt along the shores of Beleriand, particularly under the lordship of Círdan the Shipwright. These Grey-elves became skilled mariners and craftsmen of the sea, maintaining havens at the Falas including the ports of Brithombar and Eglarest before their destruction in the wars against Morgoth.The People of the Waves, those Teleri who completed the Great Journey and dwelt in Aman, particularly in the coastal city of Alqualondë. Expert mariners and shipwrights, they crafted the renowned white ships of the Teleri and became the greatest sailors among the Elves. They maintained a special friendship with Ossë and Uinen, the Maiar of the seas, and their lord was Olwë, brother of Thingol.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>Lord of Balrogs and High-captain of Angband, one of the foremost servants of Morgoth. A corrupted Maia transformed into a demon of fire and shadow, wielding a black axe and whip of flame. At the Dagor-nuin-Giliath he led the Balrogs who surrounded and mortally wounded Fëanor before retreating to Angband. At the Nirnaeth Arnoediad he held the rank of high-captain and slew Fingon, High King of the Noldor, and captured Húrin Thalion alive. His final deed was as marshal of the hosts at the Fall of Gondolin, where he was slain by Ecthelion, who leaped forward and stabbed him with the spike atop his helm. They both fell into the Fountain of the King, where Gothmog drowned with his opponent.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The handmaiden of Varda, Queen of the Stars, and one of the chiefs of the Maiar along with Eönwë. She serves the mightiest of the Valier in Ilmarin atop Taniquetil. Her name may be related to the Quenya words for starlight, being connected to such terms as Ilmen and Ilmarin, the halls where Manwë and Varda dwell.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Master of visions and dreams, dwelling in his Gardens in Valinor. With his brother Námo, he is numbered among the Fëanturi, the masters of spirits. More commonly called Lórien after his dwelling place than by his true name Irmo. His gardens lie west of Valimar and contain many types of trees and fumellar, poppies which he uses in his enchantments. Within his realm, a ring of tall shadowy cypress trees surrounds the deep cauldron Silindrin, which holds the collected dew of Telperion set upon a bed of pearls, and while its light remains he can descry many visions of mystery. Husband to Estë the Gentle.The Green Elves or Green People, those of the Nandor who later crossed the Blue Mountains and entered Beleriand, dwelling in the land of Ossiriand. Named for their attire which was often green to blend with the forests they loved, they were skilled in woodcraft and stealth, living lightly upon the land without building great cities or kingdoms. They joined the Sindar in the wars against Morgoth, though they preserved their distinct identity and customs.Spirits whose being began before the world, of the same order as the Valar but of lesser degree and power. These lesser Ainur served the greater Valar and fulfilled many roles in the shaping and governance of Arda, from tending the gardens of Lórien to bearing messages across great distances. Some, like Olórin and Curumo, would later be sent to Middle-earth in different forms, while others like Melian dwelt among the Children of Ilúvatar. Yet as beings of free will, some fell into darkness and became servants of Melkor.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Doomsman of the Valar, one of the Aratar. His true name is Námo, meaning Judge or Ordainer in Quenya, though he is more commonly called Mandos after his dwelling place. Pronounces judgment in matters of fate at the bidding of Manwë. Keeper of the Houses of the Dead, where he summons the spirits of the slain. Knows and remembers nearly all things that were and shall be, save only those that lie still in the freedom of Ilúvatar. Numbered among the Fëanturi with his brother Irmo, the masters of spirits. Husband to Vairë the Weaver, whose tapestries depicting all events of unfolding history line the ever-widening walls of his Halls. To his realm the fëar of Elves are gathered to await their respective fates, though what becomes of Men after he releases them, the Eldar do not know. Sister to Nienna. Pronounced the Doom of the Noldor after the Kinslaying at Alqualondë.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Elder King and greatest of the Aratar, appointed by Eru as Ruler of Arda and vicegerent over all its peoples. Lord of air, wind, and sky, commanding all that flies from the Veil of Arda to the smallest breezes. The birds serve as his messengers, bringing him news from the farthest and deepest places of the world. Dwells upon Taniquetil, highest of mountains, in the halls of Ilmarin with his spouse Varda. Together with her he can see farther than all other eyes, piercing through mist and darkness, and together they hear all voices from every corner of the world. Kind and compassionate ruler, unconcerned with his own power, who best understands the will of Ilúvatar. Wields a sceptre of sapphire made for him by the Noldor. His herald is Eönwë, mightiest of the Maiar in arms.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia who dwelt in the Gardens of Lórien in Valinor, tending its trees. Most beautiful, wise, and skilled in songs of enchantment among all the people of Irmo, she also served Vána and Estë. She departed from Valinor for Middle-earth and there encountered Elwë of the Teleri in the forest of Nan Elmoth, where she enchanted him with her song. They wed, and she became Queen of Doriath, the only known Ainu to take one of the Children of Ilúvatar as spouse. She bore a daughter, Lúthien Tinúviel, fairest of all the Children. Weaving great magic and mystery, she shrouded Doriath in the Girdle of Melian, an impenetrable invisible barrier, protecting the realm from Morgoth's forces. Through her daughter's marriage to Beren, her blood of the Maiar passed to both Elves and Men, and her descendants would include Elrond, Arwen, and the Kings of Númenor. After Thingol's death, she departed to Valinor where she mourned in the Halls of Mandos.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Ainur">Ainur</a><br><br>Greatest and most powerful of all the Ainur created by Eru Ilúvatar, though he fell from glory and was cast out from the company of the Valar. In the Music of the Ainur, he wove strange thoughts born of his own imagination into his song, causing discord that warred against the Theme of Ilúvatar itself, and many Ainur attuned their music to his rather than to Eru's design. Publicly rebuked by Eru, who declared that all music finds its source in himself alone, and thus Melkor could neither create his own song nor truly alter the Themes. When he entered Arda he claimed mastery over it, and his power at the beginning was so vast that he stood far beyond all the other Valar combined, capable of singlehandedly besting them at the outset of his rebellion. Corrupted many Ainur to his service, marred Arda, and waged war against the Valar and the Children of Ilúvatar. Later named Morgoth Bauglir, meaning Dark Enemy or Black Foe of the World. Eventually defeated by the Host of Valinor in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age and cast into the Timeless Void beyond the world.The Secondborn children of Ilúvatar, mortal beings who awoke in Hildórien when the Sun first rose, long after the Firstborn Elves. Granted the gift of mortality and freedom from the Music of the Ainur, their fate lay beyond the circles of the world in a mystery known only to Eru. Unlike the immortal Elves bound to Arda until its ending, Men would leave the world after death, though the shadow of Morgoth's corruption touched them early, and many fell under the dominion of darkness before ever meeting the Eldar.Sindar who dwelt in the region around Lake Mithrim in northern Beleriand, among the Grey-elves who had remained in Middle-earth during the Great Journey. They witnessed the return of the Noldor and the rising of the Moon and Sun, dwelling in lands that would become crucial in the wars against Morgoth.Elves of Darkness, all those who did not behold the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor, including the Avari and initially the Sindar. The term was used by the Eldar of Aman to distinguish those who had seen the sacred light from those who had not. However, the Noldorin Exiles discovered that the Sindar found this term offensive, leading to a shift toward the geographic terms Amanyar and Úmanyar, with Moriquendi eventually being reserved primarily for the Avari and lesser-known Elven peoples.Those Elves who turn back, Teleri who refused to cross the Misty Mountains during the Great Journey and instead remained in the valley of Anduin. Led initially by Lenwë, they wandered in the wild lands east of the mountains, eventually spreading throughout the forests of Middle-earth. Some of their number, the Laiquendi, would later cross into Beleriand, but most remained in the eastern lands, their histories largely unrecorded in the annals of the Eldar.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Valier, sister of Oromë and wife of Tulkas. Lithe and fleet of foot, she is swift as an arrow and can outrun the deer who follow her train wherever she goes in the wild. Renowned for her dancing upon the ever-green lawns of Valimar. Her name means "young" in Quenya. Wed Tulkas upon the Isle of Almaren in the Spring of Arda, and danced before the Valar upon the green grass at their wedding feast.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Aratar, the Queen of the Valar most acquainted with grief and mourning. Sister to Mandos and Irmo. Mourns for every wound that Arda has suffered in the marring of Melkor, and so great was her sorrow during the Music of the Ainur that her song turned to lamentation long before its end, weaving mourning into the themes of the World before it began. Does not weep for herself, and those who hearken to her learn pity and endurance in hope. Grey is her raiment. Dwells alone in the west of Valinor, beyond the bounds of the world, and seldom comes to Valimar where mirth and joy prevail, going often instead to the Halls of Mandos which are near to her dwelling. Among those who learned from her was Olórin, to whom she taught pity and patience. Her name contains the Quenya word for "tear."The Deep Elves or Wise, the second of the three kindreds of the Eldar, descending from the Tatyar who accepted the summons to Aman. Most skilled among the Elves in crafts and lore, they were beloved of Aulë the Smith who taught them much. Generally possessing dark hair of brown or black, they were led by Finwë to Valinor where they founded the great city of Tirion. Their insatiable thirst for knowledge and creation would eventually lead to their rebellion and return to Middle-earth in pursuit of the Silmarils.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The wisest of the Maiar, a servant to both Manwë and Varda. In his youth he dwelt in Lórien, but his ways often took him to the house of Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. Later he would be sent to Middle-earth as one of the Istari in the Third Age, and alone among that order would remain true to his mission.Creatures of Morgoth, twisted and corrupted beings created by the Dark Lord as foot soldiers in his wars against Elves and Men. According to some accounts, the first Orcs were made by capturing Elves and torturing them in the darkness until they were transformed into these monstrous forms, though their true origin remained a matter of debate among the wise. Bred for malice and destruction, they served the purposes of darkness throughout the ages.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Huntsman of the Valar and the Great Rider, one of the Aratar. Hunter of monsters and evil creatures, riding upon his white steed Nahar and blowing his great horn Valaróma, whose sound is like the upgoing of the Sun in scarlet or the sheer lightning cleaving the clouds. Loves horses and hounds, and all trees and forests. In Yavanna's woods in Valinor he trains his folk and beasts for the hunting of the fell creatures of Melkor. Brother of Nessa and husband of Vána the Ever-young. First among the Valar to discover the Elves at their awakening by the waters of Cuiviénen, and he loved the Children of Ilúvatar before they were yet fully born. Called Aldaron, Lord of Forests, and Tauron by the Sindar.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia vassal of Ulmo, spirit of the seas who loves the winds and prefers the coasts and isles of Middle-earth to the deeps. Spouse of Uinen. During the early days of Arda, he was seduced and turned to Melkor for a time, and some darkness and violence entered his spirit. He enjoys raging in storms despite the will of Ulmo, and only Uinen can restrain his wild urges. She brought him back to loyalty to Ulmo. The best known of the Maiar to the Elves, he maintained a special friendship with the Teleri, teaching them sea-craft. In the Second Age he raised the island of Númenor from the depths.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Oromë, friend of Alatar who took him along when chosen for the mission to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. The two journeyed together into the far East and South of Middle-earth, where they labored to contest the will of Sauron among the peoples of those lands. Their fate remained largely unknown in the West. In some accounts also called Rómestámo, meaning East-helper.The Speakers, the name the Elves gave to themselves, for they were the first people to use spoken language in Middle-earth. The Firstborn children of Ilúvatar, they awoke at Cuiviénen under the stars long before the rising of the Sun and Moon. Immortal and bound to the fate of Arda, they were divided into many kindreds by the choices they made in response to the summons of the Valar.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of the people of Ulmo who entered Arda with his lord. Maker of the Ulumúri, the great horns of Ulmo wrought of white conch shells. When Ulmo sounds these horns, they produce the music of the sea which echoes in the abyss and can never afterward be forgotten by those who hear it.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Aulë the Smith, mightiest of that Vala's people, originally called Mairon meaning "The Admirable" in Quenya. From Aulë he learned much of smithing and handiwork, becoming a great craftsman and mighty in lore. Coveting power through which he would coordinate all things according to his own will, he was ensnared by Melkor in the Spring of Arda and became his spy. He left the Blessed Realm for Middle-earth and bent the knee before Melkor as his greatest and most trusted servant. By the time the Elves awoke, he had command over the stronghold of Angband as Melkor's lieutenant. After Morgoth made his great fortress, he appointed this Maia to be its commander. Later took the name Sauron, and after Morgoth's defeat he did not return for judgment but hid in Middle-earth.Men, the younger children of Ilúvatar who awoke in Middle-earth millennia after the Elves, when the Sun first rose in the heavens. So named by the Firstborn to distinguish the two races of the Children, though the Secondborn were granted gifts and destinies different from their elder kindred, including the mystery of mortality and freedom from the circles of the world.The Grey-elves, those Teleri who began the Great Journey to Valinor but remained in Beleriand, never crossing the sea to the Blessed Realm. Many stayed to search for their lord Thingol who had disappeared, enchanted by Melian in the forests of Nan Elmoth. Under Thingol and Melian they established the great kingdom of Doriath and other realms in Beleriand, becoming a mighty people skilled in song and starlight, though they had never seen the Light of the Two Trees. They developed their own culture and language, distinct from both the Avari and the Calaquendi.The third and most numerous of the three kindreds of the Eldar, descending from the Nelyar who accepted the summons to Aman. During the Great Journey they became most scattered and divided, as many of their number turned aside or remained behind. Those who completed the journey to Valinor became the Falmari, master mariners of the coast of Eldamar, while those who remained in Middle-earth became the Sindar under Thingol. The Nandor who turned back at the Misty Mountains and the Laiquendi who later entered Beleriand were also of Telerin origin.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of the people of Oromë, a young hunter of that Vala's company who bore a silver bow. In the days of the Two Trees he hunted in the forests of Valinor. After the destruction of the Trees, when Telperion yielded one last silver flower, the Valar chose Tilion to guide the vessel of the Moon through the heavens. He was not as strong as Arien who guided the Sun, and he loved her, following her through the night sky. When he occasionally drew too near in his pursuit, his vessel became singed by her heat, and thus the Moon waxes and wanes in its course.Unintelligent humanoid creatures created by Morgoth before the First Age as servants and instruments of destruction. Made as mockeries of the Ents, though without the wisdom or nobility of Yavanna's shepherds, they served the Dark Lord's purposes in war and terror. Strong and brutal but slow of wit, they were vulnerable to sunlight which turned them to stone.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Champion of Valinor, greatest of the Valar in strength and deeds of prowess. Delights in wrestling and contests of strength, and needs no weapon or steed for he is so strong and swift in combat. His hair and beard are golden, his flesh ruddy, and his laughter ever joyous. Came last to Arda among the Valar, answering the call when Melkor's violence grew too great, and his coming turned the tide of battle. In the Battle of the Powers, after the long siege of Utumno, he wrestled with Melkor and cast him upon his face, binding him in the chain Angainor. Wed Nessa the sister of Oromë upon the Isle of Almaren in the Spring of Arda, in a great feast where she danced before all the Valar. His weapons are his hands, slow to wrath but slow also to forget an injury.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>Lady of the Seas, a Maia of Ulmo and spouse of Ossë. Loves and protects all creatures and weeds that live in the sea, and brings calm to the waters. She alone can restrain the tumultuous waves and wild urges of Ossë, and for this power she is loved by mariners. When Ossë turned to Melkor during the early days of Arda, it was Uinen who brought him back to loyalty to Ulmo. With Ossë, she was among the best known of the Maiar to the Elves.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Lord of Waters and King of the Sea, one of the Aratar and third in majesty after Manwë and Varda. All waters are under his government, from the great ocean Ekkaia to bays and rivers and even the waters under the earth. His spirit runs in all the veins of the world. Dwells not in Valinor but alone in the Outer Ocean, moving as he will in all the deep waters about the Earth or under the Earth, having no need of any resting place. Before the creation of Arda, when the Ainur sang before Ilúvatar, he was the best singer and maker of music among them. Speaks through the sound of water, and makes music through his great horns the Ulumúri, wrought of white shell. His voice is deep as the deepest of the seas. When he rises from the deeps, he appears dreadful and terrible as a mounting wave that strides to the land, clad in silver-green mail and wearing a helm dark and foam-crested. Loves both Elves and Men and never forsook them, sending messages through waters and dreams even when the Valar withdrew their aid.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Weaver, one of the Valier and spouse of Námo who dwells with him in the Halls of Mandos. Weaves all things that have ever been in Time into her storied webs, and the halls that ever widen as the ages pass are clothed with her tapestries depicting all events of unfolding history. The walls of those vast chambers are lined with her work, recording every deed and moment from the beginning of Arda. Her name means "Weaver" or "Ever-weaving" in Quenya, derived from the root meaning "wind" or "weave." Míriel Þerindë entered her service after returning to life, recording the deeds of the House of Finwë in thread and cloth.The Powers of the World, the mightiest of the Ainur who entered Arda to complete its material development after the Music of the Ainur determined its form. Fourteen great spirits took up this responsibility, becoming the shapers and rulers of the world, each with particular dominion over aspects of creation. Dwelling in the Blessed Realm of Valinor in the Uttermost West, they guided the destiny of Arda and summoned the Elves to dwell with them in the light of the Two Trees.The Fair Elves, the first and smallest of the three kindreds of the Eldar, descending from all the Minyar who accepted the summons to Valinor. All among them possessed golden hair, and they were the most beloved of Manwë and Varda, dwelling upon Taniquetil and in the plains of Valinor. Led by Ingwë, they were first to arrive in the Blessed Realm and never departed from it save when they marched to war against Morgoth in the final battle of the First Age.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Queen of the Valar and Lady of the Stars, one of the Aratar. Wife of Manwë and mightiest of the Valier, dwelling with him upon Taniquetil. Called Elbereth Gilthoniel by the Elves in Sindarin, and Elentári, Star-Queen, in Quenya. Too great is her beauty to be declared in words of Men or Elves, for the light of Ilúvatar lives still in her face, and in light is her power and her joy. Knows all the regions of Eä and rejoices in light. Filled the Two Lamps with radiance during the Spring of Arda. Before the awakening of the Elves, she undertook her greatest work: taking the dew from the vats of Telperion, she created new and brighter stars, setting many individual stars and also constellations, including Carnil, Luinil, Nénar, Lumbar, Alcarinquë, Elemmírë, and the Sickle of the Valar. Together with Manwë she sees beyond all eyes through mist and darkness, and with him hears all voices from every corner of the world. In Middle-earth she is most revered by the Elves, who call upon her name and sing hymns to her. The very mention of her name is said to be deadly to evil spirits. Her name Varda means "Sublime," "Exalted," or "Lofty" in Quenya.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Ever-young, one of the Valier. Younger sister of Yavanna and spouse of Oromë. Possesses influence over the flora and fauna of Middle-earth. All flowers spring as she passes and open if she glances upon them, and all birds sing at her coming. Dwells in gardens filled with golden flowers, and often comes to the forests of Oromë. The Maia Arien tended the golden flowers of her gardens, watering them with the bright dews from Laurelin in the days of the Two Trees. Melian also served Vána and Estë before departing to Middle-earth. Her name means "beautiful" in Quenya, related to unmarred beauty.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Giver of Fruits and Queen of the Earth, one of the Aratar. Called Kementári, meaning Queen of the Earth. Elder sister of Vána and spouse of Aulë, with whom she dwells in central Valinor. Lover of all things that grow in the earth, holding countless forms in her mind, from the trees like towers in forests long ago to the moss upon stones and the small secret things in the mould. All growing things answer to her, both the olvar that are rooted in place and the kelvar that move freely. In reverence she is next to Varda among the Queens of the Valar. Her usual form is that of a tall woman robed in green, though at times she takes other shapes. Some have seen her standing like a tree under heaven, crowned with the Sun and with roots plunging into the waters beneath. From her thoughts came the shapes of the Two Trees of Valinor, Telperion and Laurelin. At her request, Eru gave life to the Ents as shepherds of the trees. Her name means "Giver of Fruits" in Quenya.Those not of Aman, the term the Noldorin Exiles used to describe those Eldar who set out on the Great Journey but remained in Middle-earth without completing it. This geographic designation particularly applied to the Sindar, but could encompass the Laiquendi and more broadly all the Nandor. The term arose as a more polite alternative to Moriquendi when the returning Noldor found that the Sindar were offended by being classified among the Elves of Darkness, despite their Grey-elven nobility and the greatness of their kingdoms.
