In Beleriand, he and his brother Angrod held the highlands of Dorthonion as vassals of their elder brother Finrod, defending against Morgoth during the Siege of Angband. He and Angrod were both slain in the Dagor Bragollach, the Battle of Sudden Flame, when Morgoth broke the Siege.Immortal angelic spirits created by Eru Ilúvatar before the beginning of the World, whose being originated in the Timeless Halls beyond creation. Through the Music of the Ainur, they participated in the vision and shaping of Arda. Those who chose to enter the physical world to complete its material development became known as the Powers of Arda, divided into the mightier Valar and the lesser Maiar. As beings of free will, they could rebel against their creator, as demonstrated by Melkor's fall into darkness.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia associated with the Valië Yavanna, the Queen of Earth, possessing a strong affinity for animals and growing things. Chosen by Yavanna, he was later sent to Middle-earth as one of the Istari in the Third Age. His name in the original tongue relates to his connection with nature, and in later ages he became known for his love of beasts and birds above the concerns of Elves and Men.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Oromë the Huntsman, chosen by his lord to be sent to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. Took his friend Pallando with him on this mission. The two journeyed into the far East and South of Middle-earth, and their fate remained largely unknown to the chroniclers of the West. In some accounts also called Morinehtar, meaning Darkness-slayer.A swan-haven of the Falmari on the shores of Aman beside Belegaer, lying between the Calacirya and Araman in northern Eldamar. Built around a natural harbor of rock with a carved entrance, the city was both walled and shaped by the sea. Its quays and mansions were adorned with pearls and mother of pearl from the waters and with jewels received from the Noldor, and it was lit by many lamps so that the haven shone over the sea. The famed swanships of the Teleri were moored there, and the harbor itself was an emblem of their sea craft and love of the waves.The western continent of Arda beyond Belegaer, also called the Blessed Realm and the Undying Lands. It contains Valinor, the dwelling place of the Valar, and Eldamar, the Elvish lands of the Amanyar along the coast. The Pelóri mountains were raised along the eastern shore as a defense against Melkor, with Taniquetil as the highest peak, and the Calacirya cleft let the light of Valinor reach Eldamar and Tol Eressëa. Beyond the mountains lay regions such as Araman and Avathar. In the far north, the Helcaraxë once joined the West to Middle-earth by grinding ice, before that bridge was removed and the way to the West was guarded by the seas.Those of Aman, a term used by the Noldorin Exiles to describe themselves and those Elves who dwelt in the Blessed Realm of Valinor. The distinction arose after the Flight of the Noldor, when terminology shifted from the older Calaquendi/Moriquendi classification to the more geographically-based Amanyar/Úmanyar division, which proved less offensive to the Sindar who had never seen the Light of the Two Trees.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>The younger of the twin sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel, the youngest of their seven children born in Valinor during the days of the Two Trees. Red-haired like his twin brother Amrod, and alike in mood and face, though twins were very rare among the Eldar. Known for being hunters. Swore the Oath of Fëanor with his brothers. His mother begged Fëanor to leave the twins with her when planning the exile to Middle-earth, but he refused, and as she predicted, Amras perished in Middle-earth. Among the least mentioned of the princes of the Noldor, he and his brother are almost always referred to jointly in the histories.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>The elder of the twin sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel, the sixth of their seven children. Red-haired, though his hair grew darker than his twin Amras, and more dear to his father. Alike in mood and face with his brother, being twins, which was very rare among the Eldar. Known for being hunters. Swore the Oath of Fëanor with his brothers.

Among the least mentioned of the princes of the Noldor.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Wife of Fingolfin and mother of four children: Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon. A Noldo whose name means Holiest in Quenya. When the Noldor fled from Valinor, she refused to leave Aman even though all her children and her husband departed for Middle-earth. Her refusal was largely due to her friendship with Eärwen wife of Finarfin. She remained in the Blessed Realm while her family crossed the Helcaraxë and endured the wars of Beleriand.Melkor’s great fortress in the Iron Mountains, a dark stronghold beneath Thangorodrim that became the seat of his power in the First Age. It began as an outlying fortress and armoury to Utumno, but after Utumno was destroyed and Melkor returned to Middle-earth he rebuilt it and raised the towers of Thangorodrim above its gates. The citadel was primarily underground, with deep chambers and vaults hidden beneath the earth, while its visible peaks of ash and slag dominated the northern sky. The Noldor besieged it for centuries until the siege was broken at the Dagor Bragollach, and it was finally destroyed in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Third son of Finarfin and Eärwen, and brother to Finrod Felagund, Aegnor, and Galadriel.

Her brothers were Fingon, Turgon, and Argon. Tall and strong, fond of hunting and riding in the forests. Her skin was pale and her hair dark, and she always wore silver and white. Dwelt in Gondolin with her brother Turgon but grew weary of the hidden city and departed to seek the sons of Fëanor. In Nan Elmoth she encountered Eöl the Dark Elf, who wove a spell causing her to become lost and wander to his dwelling. They married and had a son, Maeglin. Later fled with Maeglin to Gondolin, pursued by Eöl. When Eöl threw a poisoned javelin at Maeglin, Aredhel shielded her son and was mortally wounded, dying shortly after.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Argon Arakáno, meaning High Commander, youngest child of Fingolfin and Anairë, and younger brother to Fingon, Turgon, and Aredhel. Named for his impetuous character. Accompanied his father and the host of Fingolfin across the treacherous Helcaraxë, the Grinding Ice, during the Flight of the Noldor. Upon reaching Middle-earth at the Firth of Drengist, his people were immediately assaulted by Orcs in the Battle of Lammoth. In his impetuosity, Argon dashed forward and cut a path through the enemy ranks to their captain, whom he slew, but was himself killed in that first battle upon the shores of Middle-earth. Does not appear in the published Silmarillion, being known only from Tolkien's later writings.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A maiden Maia who served in the gardens of Vána during the days of the Two Trees, watering the golden flowers with dew gathered from Laurelin. A spirit of fire uncorrupted by Melkor, she was chosen by the Valar to guide the vessel of the Sun through the airs of Arda after the destruction of the Two Trees. Her light and heat were so great that few could endure to look upon her, and when Tilion who guided the Moon drew too near in his pursuit, his vessel was singed by her radiance.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>A Noldorin Elf, one of Angrod's people, who later dwelt among the followers of Círdan the Shipwright. Sent by Círdan as a messenger together with his companion Gelmir, bearing a warning from Ulmo, Lord of Waters, regarding the fate of Nargothrond. Their journey took them first by ship to Drengist seeking the Hidden Kingdom of Turgon, but they found it not. While traveling inland they encountered Tuor seeking the Gate of the Noldor, and aided him by guiding him partway through the great tunnel to Vinyamar. After spying a great mustering of Orcs and evil creatures in the Pass of Sirion, they hastened south to Nargothrond to deliver Ulmo's warning to King Orodreth. The warning was mistrusted and rejected by Túrin, and the messengers were sent away. Nargothrond fell soon after, as Ulmo had foreseen. His name in Sindarin means "Royal Tower."The Secondborn, the race of mortal Men who awoke in Middle-earth when the Sun first rose in the heavens late in the First Age, millennia after the awakening of the Elves. Unlike the immortal Firstborn, they were granted the gift of mortality and freedom from the circles of the world, though this gift was often perceived as a doom by those who did not understand Eru's design.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Aratar, the smith and master of crafts among the Valar, and third most powerful among them. Governs the substances of the earth and delights in works of craft, from the smallest to the forging of lands and mountains. Made the rocks, gems, and all minerals of Arda. Called Mahal by the Dwarves, whom he created in secret during his impatience for the awakening of the Children of Ilúvatar, fashioning the Seven Fathers and teaching them his craft. When discovered by Eru, he humbly offered his creations to Ilúvatar's will, who accepted them as adopted children and bade them sleep until after the Elves awoke. Husband to Yavanna, with whom he dwells in central Valinor. Among his pupils were the Maiar Curumo and Mairon, and he taught much of his craft to the Noldor.The Refusers or Unwilling, those Quendi who rejected the summons of the Valar and refused to undertake the Great Journey to Valinor. Their initial population included more than one-third of all Elves, evenly divided between the Tatyar and Nelyar kindreds. After their refusal, they fragmented into many separate kindreds with different languages as they spread across Middle-earth, remaining largely outside the histories preserved by the Eldar.Corrupted Maiar who followed Melkor in his rebellion and were transformed into demons of terror and flame. These powerful spirits of fire and shadow served as Morgoth's most terrible servants, dwelling in the depths of Angband and leading his armies in battle. Their true nature as fallen Ainur made them formidable adversaries even to the mightiest of the Children of Ilúvatar.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Beleg Cúthalion, meaning Strongbow, chief captain of the Sindar and one of the greatest warriors of the First Age. Together with Mablung, he served King Thingol as a captain of the Marchwardens, guarding Doriath's northern borders.

Became friend and brother-in-arms of Túrin Turambar, teaching him the ways of the forest and warfare. Later bore the great sword Anglachel, one of two blades forged by Eöl from a meteorite. His deeds of valor were sung in many songs, and he was known for his loyalty, skill in battle, and compassion. Died in tragic circumstances while attempting to rescue Túrin from captivity.The Great Sea, also called the Sundering Seas or Western Sea, lying west of Middle-earth and east of Aman. Before the Second Age it stretched from the Gap of Ilmen in the far north, where the Helcaraxë formed a bridge of ice between Aman and Middle-earth, to far southern waters, with its widest span near the equator and Aman forming its western edge. After the War of Wrath the sea was widened by the drowning of much land, removing the northern ice bridge. In the Downfall of Númenor the world was bent and Aman removed, and only the Straight Road led west to the Undying Lands. Its bays and islands, including the Bay of Balar and Tol Eressëa, shape the maritime geography of the Elder Days.The north-western region of Middle-earth in the First Age, once a name only for the lands near the Bay of Balar but later applied to the whole land. It lay along the Great Sea with a long western shoreline and was bounded in the east by the Ered Luin, the Blue Mountains. The River Sirion ran north to south and divided West and East Beleriand, while the Andram formed a long wall of hills across its center, and the Gelion with its tributaries drained Ossiriand in the east. Its western rivers Brithon and Nenning flowed through the Falas. In the War of Wrath most of Beleriand was drowned and only a remnant endured as Lindon, leaving its former realms and cities as memory and legend.The pass in the Pelóri north of Taniquetil, with Tirion built upon the hill of Túna within it. It was called the Cleft of Light because the light of the Two Trees came through the gap to illuminate Eldamar, and the rocks of its walls were said to hold many jewels. After the Hiding of Valinor it remained the lone cleft through the mountains, kept open so the Elves could breathe the outer air and see the stars, and so the Vanyar and Noldor would not be wholly separated from the Teleri on the coast. The Quenya name means Light cleft, from elements for light and cleft.Elves of Light, comprising the Vanyar, Noldor, and those Teleri who completed the Great Journey and beheld the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor in the Blessed Realm. This term distinguished them from the Moriquendi who never saw that sacred light. After the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, the Exiles found this terminology offensive to the Sindar and largely ceased its use except in written lore, preferring the terms Amanyar and Úmanyar instead.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>The fourth son of Fëanor and Nerdanel, known as Caranthir the Dark. His father-name was Morifinwë, meaning Dark Finwë, for he was black-haired as his grandfather. Among the sons of Fëanor he was the harshest and quickest to anger. Swore the Oath of Fëanor with his brothers and followed them into exile. Ruled in Thargelion in eastern Beleriand. Rescued Haleth and her people the Haladin when they were besieged by Orcs, recognizing the valor of Men, and offered them lands in his domain, though Haleth's pride led her to decline and settle instead in Brethil.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>A Sindarin prince of Doriath, kinsman of King Thingol. According to some accounts, grandson of Elmo, Thingol's brother. Dwelt in Doriath during the First Age, where he met and wedded Galadriel of the Noldor, who remained in the hidden kingdom for love of him rather than going to Nargothrond with her brother Finrod. Their union brought together the houses of the Sindar and Noldor. Together they ruled the woodland realm of Lothlórien in later ages, becoming Lord and Lady of the Golden Wood. Through his Telerin heritage and kinship to Thingol, he shared the ancient wisdom and long memory of the Elves who first awakened at Cuiviénen.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Son of Curufin, greatest of the craftsmen of Eregion and lord of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, the People of the Jewel-smiths. As a craftsman he was second only to Fëanor his grandfather, surpassing in cunning all others who have ever wrought save Fëanor alone. In the Second Age he forged the Rings of Power in Eregion. The greatest rings were his own work, never touched by Sauron: the Three Rings of the Elves named Vilya, Narya, and Nenya after the elements of air, fire, and water. When Sauron's treachery was revealed and he forged the One Ring, war came to Eregion. Sauron laid waste to the realm, and Celebrimbor perished in the destruction.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>The third son of Fëanor and Nerdanel, a great huntsman who was a friend of the Vala Oromë.

Creator of the Cirth, the runic writing system he devised before the Year of the Trees 1300, which he later expanded into the Angerthas Daeron. The Dwarves who visited Menegroth learned these runes from him and held him in higher esteem than did his own people, carrying the Cirth east over the Blue Mountains where they became widely used. Loved Lúthien Tinúviel, daughter of Thingol, but his love was unrequited. When she fled Doriath, he became lost searching for her and eventually wandered into the east, and his fate thereafter remained unknown to the chroniclers of the West.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Half-elven">Half-elven</a><br><br>Dior Eluchíl, meaning Thingol's Heir, son of Beren Erchamion and Lúthien Tinúviel, and first of the Peredhil.

Called Dior Aranel the Beautiful. Wedded Nimloth, a Sindarin maiden of Doriath, and they had three children: twin sons Eluréd and Elurín, and daughter Elwing. After the deaths of Thingol and the departure of Melian, he came to Menegroth with his family and set himself to raise anew the glory of Doriath, becoming its king. When Beren and Lúthien sent him the Silmaril from the Nauglamír before their final passing, he wore it, and its fame spread. The Sons of Fëanor, driven by their Oath, assaulted Menegroth in the Second Kinslaying. Dior and Nimloth were both slain defending their realm, though Elwing escaped with the Silmaril to the Havens of Sirion.A mighty forest kingdom of Elu Thingol, the greatest realm of the Sindar in central Beleriand. Its capital was Menegroth, and its lands were a great ring of woods about the River Sirion, including Neldoreth the northern beech forest, Nivrim the west march oaks, and the forests of Region and Radhrim; Brethil and Nan Elmoth were also held though they lay outside the later enchantment. The realm was known as the Guarded Realm and the Hidden Kingdom, for Melian’s Girdle protected it and turned aside foes and wanderers. It was a cultural and political heart for the Sindar, long preserved from open war by its guarded borders and the wisdom of its king and queen.Ancient creatures of fire and malice, first brought forth by Morgoth in Angband as weapons of war and terror. Glaurung, Father of Dragons, was the first of the Fire-drakes, combining immense physical power with cunning intelligence and the ability to enchant and deceive through speech and gaze. These serpents of flame became instruments of destruction in the wars of Beleriand.The children of Aulë the Smith, created by the Vala in his impatience for the awakening of the Children of Ilúvatar, though Eru granted them true life and independent will. Makers and craftsmen of great skill, they were given their own language Khuzdul by their creator. Seven fathers of the Dwarves were made, each founding a great house of their kindred, and they proved themselves steadfast and enduring despite not being among the original designs of Eru.Great Eagles or Eagles of Manwë, immense sentient birds who served as messengers and agents of the Lord of the Winds.

Possessed the most beautiful voice and greatest musical talent with the flute among all the people of the hidden city. During the Fall of Gondolin, when Morgoth's forces breached the walls and Balrogs entered the city, he made his stand near the Fountain of the King in the Square of the King. Regaining his strength by drinking from the fountain, he fought with such valor that his defense was remembered in all songs and tales as among the most valiant deeds of the Elder Days. In that final battle he faced Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs and High-captain of Angband. Leaping forward, he stabbed Gothmog with the spike atop his helm, and both fell into the Fountain of the King, where they perished together.The Elf-friends, specifically those Houses of Men who allied with the Elves during the First Age in Beleriand and fought against Morgoth. Distinguished from other Men by their friendship with the Eldar and their valor in the wars of the Silmarils, they were granted the island realm of Númenor as a reward for their faithfulness. The term particularly applies to the Three Houses who first entered Beleriand and their descendants.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Lord of the House of the Heavenly Arch, one of the twelve houses of Gondolin. Wore a blue mantle embroidered with stars of crystal, and uniquely among the lords of the Noldor carried a bent sword. His house was arrayed in many bright colors, for the heavenly arch they honored was the rainbow, and they were a folk of great wealth. During the Fall of Gondolin, the people of the Arch defended the northern walls alongside the House of the Swallow, pouring rain of arrows upon the hosts of Orcs below. One of only two lords besides Tuor to survive the destruction of the Hidden City, escaping with the refugees through the secret way. Later perished in battle at the Mouths of Sirion.The Forsaken, a group of Teleri who remained behind in the coastal regions of Middle-earth to search for their lord Thingol, who had disappeared near the end of the Great Journey. These Elves missed their chance to cross the sea to Valinor when the island ferry departed without them, and they became part of the Sindar of Beleriand, dwelling in the lands that would become the realm of Doriath.Those Elves who accepted the summons of the Valar and began the Great Journey from Cuiviénen to Aman, even if they did not complete it. The name means "People of the Stars" and distinguishes them from the Avari who refused the call.

One of the Vanyar, whose golden hair passed to her daughter. The only known full Vanya who accompanied the Flight of the Noldor and came under the Doom of Mandos. When the Noldor crossed the perilous Helcaraxë after Fëanor departed with the ships, she and Idril fell into the bitter waters. Turgon risked his life to save them but could only save Idril, and Elenwë was covered in fallen ice and lost. She died before reaching Middle-earth, and thus no Vanya is known to have set foot in Middle-earth until the Host of Valinor came in the War of Wrath. Turgon was thereafter always enmitied with the House of Fëanor after losing his wife in the crossing.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Half-elven">Half-elven</a><br><br>Son of Eärendil the Mariner and Elwing the White, twin brother of Elros, and bearer of the Elven-ring Vilya.

When the Valar granted the Half-elven the choice of their fate, he chose to be counted among the Elves. Fought with Gil-galad in the War of the Last Alliance against Sauron. After the fall of Eregion, he established the refuge of Imladris, called Rivendell, where he dwelt as Lord and master of that realm through the Second and Third Ages.

Born at the Havens of Sirion, and like his brother was caught in the Third Kinslaying and fostered by the Sons of Fëanor. When the Valar granted the Half-elven their choice, he chose to be counted among Men, though the Valar granted him and his descendants a lifespan far beyond that of other mortals. Became the first King of Númenor, taking the royal name Tar-Minyatur in Quenya, meaning High First-ruler, thus establishing the tradition for Númenórean kings to take Quenya throne-names. Founded the realm in the year 32 of the Second Age and ruled for 410 years, remaining unwearied until he was five hundred years old. From him descended the Line of Elros, the Kings and Queens of Númenor, and later the Kings of Arnor and Gondor in Middle-earth.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Quendi">Quendi</a><br><br>The Firstborn children of Ilúvatar, who awoke at Cuiviénen under the stars.

Had two elder twin brothers, Eluréd and Elurín, who were lost in the forest after the Sack of Menegroth. During the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion, when the Sons of Fëanor came to reclaim the Silmaril won by her grandparents Beren and Lúthien, she refused to surrender it. In desperation as the Havens fell, she cast herself into the sea with the Silmaril. Through the power of Ulmo, she was transformed into a great white bird and flew to Eärendil bearing the jewel upon her breast. The Silmaril's light guided them through the Shadowy Seas to Valinor. Mother of twin sons Elrond and Elros. When the Valar offered the Half-elven their choice, she chose to be counted among the Elves, as did Eärendil for her sake. While her husband sails the heavens as a star, she dwells in a tower on the shores of the Sea, and it is said that the sea-birds taught her their language, and she can take their form and fly to meet Eärendil as he returns.Ancient shepherds of the trees, placed upon Middle-earth by the will of Yavanna the Giver of Fruits in response to her concerns about the fate of growing things. These tree-like beings possessed great strength and longevity, dwelling in forests and protecting the olvar from harm. They were granted life and consciousness to serve as guardians of all that grows, though they moved slowly and spoke in a language as deep and long as the roots of mountains.Eru Ilúvatar is the transcendent creator who exists eternally in the Timeless Halls beyond the world and bears the Flame Imperishable, the power by which true life is kindled. From his thought he brought forth the Ainur, and to teach them he set before them his theme in the form of music; as they learned to sing together, the Great Music unfolded. Out of that Music he revealed a Vision of the world and its history, and then he spoke the word “Eä,” giving being to the universe itself. Many of the Ainur entered Eä and became the Valar and the Maiar, shaping Arda according to the design shown in the Vision, while Ilúvatar remained beyond the world yet loved it and set its laws and bounds. When discord arose in the Music, he introduced new themes that could not be quenched and declared that no theme can be played that does not have its source in him, so even rebellion would be woven into a greater harmony. He is called Eru, “He that is Alone,” and Ilúvatar, “Father of All,” and the Children of Ilúvatar are the Elves and Men, the Firstborn and the Secondborn. He rarely intervenes directly, but life and fate are ultimately his gift and his design stands above all.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Gentle, one of the Valier with power to heal all hurts and weariness. Wife of Irmo, dwelling with him in the Gardens of Lórien. Grey is her raiment, and rest is her gift. Her favorite place is an island on the tree-shadowed lake of Lórellin in the Gardens of Lórien, where she sleeps during the day. The Eldar, the Maiar, and even the Valar visit the Gardens to rest and be refreshed by its fountains, receiving healing through her ministrations.The green mound at the heart of Valinor, set within the Ring of Doom near Valimar, hallowed by Yavanna and made evergreen. Upon this hill the Two Trees, Telperion and Laurelin, grew, after Yavanna sang upon the grass and Nienna watered it with her tears, and the Valar sat in council to witness the Trees’ awakening. Later, Melkor and Ungoliant came to the mound and destroyed the Trees, leaving it darkened and defiled until the winds of Manwë cleared the vapours and Nienna washed the mound. The name means Green Mound, and it also bore the Quenya name Corollairë, Mound of Summer.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Half-elven">Half-elven</a><br><br>Eärendil the Mariner, son of Tuor of the House of Hador and Idril Celebrindal, daughter of Turgon.

When Elwing came to him transformed into a white bird bearing the Silmaril upon her breast, its light guided them through the Shadowy Seas to the Blessed Realm. There he came before the Valar as ambassador of both Elves and Men and moved them to pity. The Valar hallowed his ship, set it in the heavens with the Silmaril upon his brow, and he became a living star sailing the firmament.

Wife of Finarfin and mother of Finrod, Angrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel. Her children, being in part Sea-elves through their mother, had a love of the sea and longing for distant places, and it was partly due to this inheritance that all four chose to join the exile to Middle-earth, though Eärwen herself remained in Aman. Because of their Telerin blood through Eärwen, her children were well received in Doriath, the realm of her father's elder brother Thingol. Her name means Sea-maiden.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Known as the Dark Elf, a great smith who dwelt alone in the forest of Nan Elmoth in East Beleriand.

Devised galvorn, a black metal of great strength and malleability that he alone knew how to forge, fashioning it into armor that he wore. Forged two great swords from the iron of a fallen meteorite: Anglachel, which he gave as tribute to Thingol and later bore by Beleg and Túrin, and Anguirel which he kept for himself. Using enchantments, he caused Aredhel, sister of Turgon, to become lost in his forest and come to his dwelling. They wed and had a son, Maeglin. When Aredhel fled with Maeglin to Gondolin, Eöl followed them. Brought before Turgon's judgment, in his wrath he threw a poisoned javelin at Maeglin, but Aredhel intercepted it and was mortally wounded. For this kinslaying, Eöl was cast from the cliff of Caragdûr.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The banner-bearer and herald of Manwë, and chief of the Maiar along with Ilmarë. His might in arms is surpassed by none in Arda, making him the greatest warrior among all the Maiar. When Manwë decided to answer the appeal of Eärendil, he gave his sword to Eönwë and sent him to Middle-earth to lead the Host of the Valar in the War of Wrath. It was Eönwë who overthrew Morgoth in that final battle. After the war, he took the two remaining Silmarils and held them for safekeeping. When Sauron paid obeisance to him and abjured his evil deeds, Eönwë commanded him to return to Aman to receive Manwë's judgment, for he himself had not the power to pardon such a one.The coastal Sindar who dwelt along the shores of Beleriand, particularly under the lordship of Círdan the Shipwright. These Grey-elves became skilled mariners and craftsmen of the sea, maintaining havens at the Falas including the ports of Brithombar and Eglarest before their destruction in the wars against Morgoth.The People of the Waves, those Teleri who completed the Great Journey and dwelt in Aman, particularly in the coastal city of Alqualondë.

During the Flight of the Noldor, dismayed by the Doom of Mandos and the tragedy of the Kinslaying of his wife's people at Alqualondë, he turned back to Valinor with a portion of his people. Thereafter he was reckoned King of the Noldor who remained in Aman. Because of his choice, his children and the House of Finarfin were well received in Doriath by Thingol, who was Eärwen's uncle. Led the Valinorean Noldor to Middle-earth in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, though he returned to Valinor afterward.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Second son of Finwë, born of his second wife Indis of the Vanyar, making him half-Vanyarin.

When the Siege was broken in the Dagor Bragollach, he rode to Angband in wrath and despair and challenged Morgoth to single combat. In that duel he wounded Morgoth seven times with wounds that never fully healed, and dealt one last stab to Morgoth's foot before his death. His body was rescued by Thorondor King of Eagles and brought to a mountaintop overlooking Gondolin, where Turgon built a cairn.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Eldest son of Fingolfin and Anairë, and later second High King of the Noldor. Renowned for his daring rescue of Maedhros, his cousin and friend, from Thangorodrim. Traveling alone and unseen, he climbed the precipices but could not find Maedhros until he sang a song of Valinor in both despair and defiance. Maedhros answered from above in his torment, and Fingon called to Manwë to speed his arrow. Thorondor the King of Eagles swooped down and lifted Fingon up, but to free Maedhros he was forced to cut off his cousin's hand. This deed healed the breach between the Houses of Fingolfin and Fëanor. Ruled as High King from the death of his father in single combat with Morgoth until he was slain by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Eldest son of Finarfin and Eärwen, called Felagund by the Dwarves, meaning Maker of Caves.

Later wed Indis of the Vanyar, who bore him Fingolfin and Finarfin. When Fëanor was banished from Tirion, Finwë went with him into exile at Formenos.

Among its lakes is Lórellin, and the gardens are frequented by spirits who serve the Vala of visions and dreams. Nightingales sang there, and the Eldar, Maiar, and even the Valar came to rest and be refreshed by its fountains. Tilion was said to dream by the pools of Estë beneath the light of Telperion, and Melian sang there when the lights of the Two Trees mingled. Míriel also laid herself down in Lórien and released her fëa, and the name is linked to notions of slumber and dreaming.The principal river of East Beleriand, forming the western boundary of Ossiriand and draining the lands between the Ered Luin and the eastern plains. It arose from two sources, the Little Gelion from Himring and the Greater Gelion from Mount Rerir, then flowed south for many leagues, dividing Estolad from Thargelion before meeting the River Ascar near Sarn Athrad. From there it became the boundary of Ossiriand and was fed by the six other rivers of that land, growing swifter and broader after the falls; dwarves of the Blue Mountains called the lower course Gabilān. Though less wide than Sirion, it ran faster and, after joining Adurant, turned southwest to Belegaer.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>A Noldorin Elf, originally one of Angrod's people. After the Dagor Bragollach, he wandered into the southern regions of Beleriand and settled among the folk of Círdan the Shipwright. Later sent by Círdan as a messenger together with his companion Arminas, bearing Ulmo's warning to Nargothrond. During their journey they encountered Tuor at the very Gate of the Noldor, which he sought, and aided him on his path. They brought tidings to King Orodreth of a great mustering of Orcs in the Pass of Sirion, and Ulmo's warning that great peril drew nigh to Nargothrond. The warning was mistrusted by Túrin and rejected, and the messengers were sent away. Nargothrond fell soon thereafter as Ulmo had foreseen. Both he and Arminas were Calaquendi, born in Valinor before the Exile.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Son of Guilin, a lord of Nargothrond, and elder brother of Gwindor.

At the beginning of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Morgoth's forces brought him forth before the assembled host and brutally mutilated him, cutting off his hands and feet before finally slaying him. This atrocity was performed in full view of the armies, intended to provoke them. Seeing his brother's fate, Gwindor broke ranks in fury and charged prematurely across the plains of Anfauglith toward Angband with his company, thus beginning the battle before the appointed signal and dooming the Union of Maedhros to defeat.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Fourth and last High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth, who held the kingship throughout the Second Age, far longer than any of his predecessors.

His house bore the device of a rayed sun upon their shields, and he wore a mantle embroidered with celandines in golden threads, with arms damascened in gold. When Gondolin fell to Morgoth's forces, he led many survivors through the secret way contrived by Idril. At the pass of Cirith Thoronath in the Encircling Mountains, the refugees were ambushed by Orcs and a Balrog. The Eagles came to their aid, but Glorfindel fought the Balrog alone upon a pinnacle of rock in single combat. He dealt the demon a mortal wound, but both fell together into the abyss. Thorondor King of Eagles retrieved his body, and a cairn was raised over him on a mountaintop, covered with grass and yellow flowers. His duel became legendary, and his name was sung in many songs of heroic sacrifice.The Hidden City of the Noldor in the vale of Tumladen, north of Beleriand, surrounded by the Encircling Mountains. Turgon founded it after Ulmo guided him to the secret valley, and his people, who had dwelt in Nevrast, moved there in secrecy to become the Gondolindrim. Concealed from friend and foe alike, the city was guarded by the Eagles of Thorondor and endured for nearly four hundred years as the last great Elven realm against Morgoth. Its seclusion, mountain ring, and ordered life made it legendary, until it was discovered through treachery and fell, with a few survivors escaping to the Mouths of Sirion.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>Lord of Balrogs and High-captain of Angband, one of the foremost servants of Morgoth. A corrupted Maia transformed into a demon of fire and shadow, wielding a black axe and whip of flame. At the Dagor-nuin-Giliath he led the Balrogs who surrounded and mortally wounded Fëanor before retreating to Angband. At the Nirnaeth Arnoediad he held the rank of high-captain and slew Fingon, High King of the Noldor, and captured Húrin Thalion alive.

His folk were notable contributors to the building of the deep mansions of Nargothrond, dwelling to its west on the slopes of Taur-en-Faroth, the Hunters' Wold. Lost his elder son Gelmir during the Dagor Bragollach when he was captured by Morgoth's forces. At the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Gelmir was displayed and slain before the host, provoking Gwindor's reckless charge that began the battle prematurely. Hastened forth with great joy upon learning of Gwindor's return after fourteen years, holding him in sweet embrace despite the torments he had endured. Later witnessed the fall of both Gwindor and King Orodreth at the Battle of Tumhalad, and the destruction of Nargothrond soon after.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Son of Guilin and brother of Gelmir, an Elf-lord of Nargothrond betrothed to Finduilas, daughter of King Orodreth. Reckoned as a bold leader and the scout who ranged farthest afield of all the folk of Nargothrond. At the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, when he saw his brother Gelmir's mutilated body displayed by the enemy, he charged in fury across the plains of Anfauglith toward Angband's gates with a small company, thus beginning the battle before the signal was given. His company broke through to Angband's very doors, causing Morgoth himself to tremble, but they were ambushed within and all save Gwindor were slain. He endured fourteen years of torment as a thrall in Angband's mines before escaping. Encountered Beleg Cúthalion searching for Túrin, and together they freed Túrin from Orc captivity, though Beleg died in the attempt. Brought Túrin to Nargothrond, where Finduilas grew to love Túrin instead. He counseled against open war with Morgoth, but Túrin's will prevailed. Mortally wounded at the Battle of Tumhalad, with his dying words he charged Túrin to save Finduilas, warning that she alone could save him from his doom.A region of Valinor associated with Námo, the Doomsman of the Valar, who is named for his dwelling. The Halls lie westward in Valinor, near the halls of Nienna, and are described as the place to which the dead of Arda are summoned, with the fëar of Elves and Men gathered there and kept apart according to their kind. Vairë the Weaver also dwells there, recording the histories of the world in her tapestries. In Valinor’s geography they stand between the far western halls and the more central regions, forming a solemn counterpoint to the Gardens of Lórien and the other blessed lands.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Idril Celebrindal, only child of King Turgon of Gondolin and his Vanyarin wife Elenwë. Her mother died during the crossing of the Helcaraxë, and thus did not set foot in Middle-earth. Wife of Tuor and mother of Eärendil the Mariner. Wise and far-seeing, and her heart misgave her with foreboding as a cloud. Therefore she prepared a secret way out of Gondolin, contriving that this work was not known to Maeglin. When the Fall of Gondolin began, she and Tuor used this secret passage to lead many survivors out of the city and save their lives. Gave her son the mother-name Ardamírë, that foretold his destiny. Her union with Tuor was the second union of Elves and Men, after Beren and Lúthien, and from them descended the Half-elven.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The handmaiden of Varda, Queen of the Stars, and one of the chiefs of the Maiar along with Eönwë.

Ingwë dwells upon Taniquetil beneath the halls of Manwë, and never returned or set eyes upon Middle-earth again after the Great Journey. The Vanyar departed from Valinor only once, when they marched to war against Morgoth in the final battle of the First Age.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Master of visions and dreams, dwelling in his Gardens in Valinor.

They joined the Sindar in the wars against Morgoth, though they preserved their distinct identity and customs.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Lúthien Tinúviel, meaning Nightingale, fairest of all the Children of Ilúvatar who have ever lived or shall ever live. Only child of Elu Thingol, King of Doriath, and Melian the Maia, thus the sole offspring of the union between one of the Ainur and one of the Elves. Through her mother she possessed powers greater than any other of the Eldar, including gifts of enchantment, song, and the ability to cast sleep upon even the mightiest. In the woods of Neldoreth she encountered Beren, a mortal Man of the House of Bëor, and they fell in love, becoming the first union of Elf and Man. Together they achieved deeds of legend, including the recovery of a Silmaril from Morgoth's Iron Crown, and their song and dance put even the Dark Lord and his court into slumber. When Beren died, she chose mortality to be with him, and through their union the blood of both Elves and Maiar passed into the lines of Men, from whom descended the Half-elven and the Kings of Númenor.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Mablung of the Heavy Hand, a Sindarin Elf who served King Thingol of Doriath as chief captain and march-warden. His name, meaning "with weighted hand," was likely an epessë rather than his birth name, earned through his prowess in battle. Together with Beleg Cúthalion, he was one of the two great captains of the Sindar. When King Thingol refused involvement in the Union of Maedhros, only Beleg and Mablung among all the warriors of Doriath went forth to fight in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad alongside the other Free Peoples against Morgoth. After Beleg departed to search for Túrin, Mablung became Captain of the Guard of Doriath. He witnessed many of the great deeds and tragedies of the age.

Morgoth held him captive for thirty years, hanging him by a steel shackle about his right wrist from the face of a precipice of Thangorodrim. His cousin Fingon, aided by Thorondor King of Eagles, rescued him in a daring deed, but was forced to cut off Maedhros's hand to free him from the shackle. Later organized the Union of Maedhros to unite the peoples of Beleriand against Morgoth, though the Union ended in defeat at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Son of Eöl the Dark Elf and Aredhel, sister of Turgon.

Eöl tried to kill Maeglin with a poisoned javelin, but instead slew Aredhel, and for this crime was executed by being thrown from the cliff of Caragdûr. Maeglin became mighty in Gondolin but later, while searching for ore in defiance of Turgon's laws, strayed too far and was captured by Orcs and taken to Angband. Daunted by tortures, he bought his life by betraying Gondolin, motivated also by hatred for Tuor and desire for Idril. During the Fall of Gondolin he laid hands on Idril and Eärendil, but Tuor fought him upon the walls and threw him down to his death, striking the mountain three times before falling into the flames.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Second son of Fëanor and Nerdanel, the greatest minstrel and bard of the Noldor.

Wore a copper circlet upon his head. Unusual among Elves for bearing a beard early in his second cycle of life, when most Eldar could grow beards only from their third cycle onward. His hair was brown with glints of coppery-red, rather than the black typical of most Noldor, and this coloring passed to some of his descendants. Remained loyal to the Valar and did not join the rebellion of the Noldor, staying in Aman when Fëanor led the Exile.Spirits whose being began before the world, of the same order as the Valar but of lesser degree and power. These lesser Ainur served the greater Valar and fulfilled many roles in the shaping and governance of Arda, from tending the gardens of Lórien to bearing messages across great distances.

Together with her he can see farther than all other eyes, piercing through mist and darkness, and together they hear all voices from every corner of the world. Kind and compassionate ruler, unconcerned with his own power, who best understands the will of Ilúvatar. Wields a sceptre of sapphire made for him by the Noldor. His herald is Eönwë, mightiest of the Maiar in arms.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia who dwelt in the Gardens of Lórien in Valinor, tending its trees. Most beautiful, wise, and skilled in songs of enchantment among all the people of Irmo, she also served Vána and Estë. She departed from Valinor for Middle-earth and there encountered Elwë of the Teleri in the forest of Nan Elmoth, where she enchanted him with her song. They wed, and she became Queen of Doriath, the only known Ainu to take one of the Children of Ilúvatar as spouse. She bore a daughter, Lúthien Tinúviel, fairest of all the Children. Weaving great magic and mystery, she shrouded Doriath in the Girdle of Melian, an impenetrable invisible barrier, protecting the realm from Morgoth's forces. Through her daughter's marriage to Beren, her blood of the Maiar passed to both Elves and Men, and her descendants would include Elrond, Arwen, and the Kings of Númenor. After Thingol's death, she departed to Valinor where she mourned in the Halls of Mandos.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Ainur">Ainur</a><br><br>Greatest and most powerful of all the Ainur created by Eru Ilúvatar, though he fell from glory and was cast out from the company of the Valar. In the Music of the Ainur, he wove strange thoughts born of his own imagination into his song, causing discord that warred against the Theme of Ilúvatar itself, and many Ainur attuned their music to his rather than to Eru's design. Publicly rebuked by Eru, who declared that all music finds its source in himself alone, and thus Melkor could neither create his own song nor truly alter the Themes. When he entered Arda he claimed mastery over it, and his power at the beginning was so vast that he stood far beyond all the other Valar combined, capable of singlehandedly besting them at the outset of his rebellion. Corrupted many Ainur to his service, marred Arda, and waged war against the Valar and the Children of Ilúvatar. Later named Morgoth Bauglir, meaning Dark Enemy or Black Foe of the World. Eventually defeated by the Host of Valinor in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age and cast into the Timeless Void beyond the world.The Secondborn children of Ilúvatar, mortal beings who awoke in Hildórien when the Sun first rose, long after the Firstborn Elves. Granted the gift of mortality and freedom from the Music of the Ainur, their fate lay beyond the circles of the world in a mystery known only to Eru. Unlike the immortal Elves bound to Arda until its ending, Men would leave the world after death, though the shadow of Morgoth's corruption touched them early, and many fell under the dominion of darkness before ever meeting the Eldar.The Thousand Caves, an underground city of Doriath above the River Esgalduin, home to King Thingol and Queen Melian. It was a cavern town hewn into a rocky hill by the Dwarves of Belegost, with its only entrance by gates high above the river and a stone bridge spanning a deep ravine. Within were vast halls and the Menelrond where Thingol’s throne stood. The pillars were shaped like beeches with branches and leaves, the halls were lit by golden lanterns and silver fountains, and the caves held carvings and figurines of animals. It became the most beautiful palace east of the Sea and the royal heart of the Sindar.The central continent of Arda, lying east of Belegaer and west of the Land of the Sun across the East Sea. Most of the history of Arda takes place here, and it is where the Children of Ilúvatar, Elves and Men, came into being along with the Dwarves. In the Elder Days the inland seas of Helcar and Ringil lay to the north and south of its center after the fall of the Two Lamps. The Westlands are the best known portion: their western part, Beleriand, was drowned at the end of the First Age, and survivors relocated to Lindon and Eriador beyond the Blue Mountains. The continent is also called Endor or Ennorath in Elvish tongues.Sindar who dwelt in the region around Lake Mithrim in northern Beleriand, among the Grey-elves who had remained in Middle-earth during the Great Journey. They witnessed the return of the Noldor and the rising of the Moon and Sun, dwelling in lands that would become crucial in the wars against Morgoth.Elves of Darkness, all those who did not behold the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor, including the Avari and initially the Sindar. The term was used by the Eldar of Aman to distinguish those who had seen the sacred light from those who had not. However, the Noldorin Exiles discovered that the Sindar found this term offensive, leading to a shift toward the geographic terms Amanyar and Úmanyar, with Moriquendi eventually being reserved primarily for the Avari and lesser-known Elven peoples.A court near Valimar where the Valar held their councils, described as a circle filled with their thrones. It lay outside Valimar’s western gates, and within its ring stood the green mound of Ezellohar, where the Two Trees once grew. The Valar sat there to witness Yavanna’s song that awakened the Trees, and thereafter they held their great councils bathed in their light. The Ring of Doom is thus a central place of judgment and decision in Valinor, associated with the most momentous choices in the history of Eä. The Quenya name Máhanaxar is tied to the idea of authority and a ring.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>First wife of Finwë, King of the Noldor, and mother of Fëanor. Her name means Jewel-daughter, and her mother-name was Þerindë or Serindë, meaning the Broideress, for her chief talent was marvelous dexterity of hand in embroidery and needlework. Fëanor had an unusually long gestation, and his birth drew so much of her life energy that afterward she grew weary of living. She departed to the gardens of Lórien, where she voluntarily left her corporeal form. Her fëa went to the Halls of Mandos, where she became handmaid to Vairë the Weaver, fulfilling her craft by weaving historical tapestries telling the deeds of the Noldor.Those Elves who turn back, Teleri who refused to cross the Misty Mountains during the Great Journey and instead remained in the valley of Anduin. Led initially by Lenwë, they wandered in the wild lands east of the mountains, eventually spreading throughout the forests of Middle-earth. Some of their number, the Laiquendi, would later cross into Beleriand, but most remained in the eastern lands, their histories largely unrecorded in the annals of the Eldar.A stronghold built by Finrod Felagund and delved into the banks of the River Narog in West Beleriand. Its deep halls and armouries were carved after the fashion of Menegroth, forming a hidden fortress and royal seat. It became the capital of a realm between the rivers Nenning, Narog, and Teiglin, including Taur-en-Faroth, Talath Dirnen, and Tumhalad, and Finrod was overlord of the Elves of West Beleriand except the Falathrim. Its underground architecture, river setting, and broad realm made it one of the greatest Noldorin centers of power and refuge in the First Age.The chief river of West Beleriand and the largest tributary of Sirion, rising from the Pools of Ivrin in the Ered Wethrin. From its source it flowed south and then southeast, passing through a gorge and rapids as it crossed the Andram, before meeting Sirion in Nan tathren not far above the Mouths of Sirion. Its principal tributaries were the Ginglith and the Ringwil, and just south of the Ringwil’s inflow the city of Nargothrond was carved into its western bank. The Narog’s swift course, rapids, and gorge shaped the landscape of western Beleriand and the defenses of its great Noldorin stronghold.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Daughter of Mahtan the smith and wife of Fëanor. A skilled sculptor who made statues so lifelike that people thought them real and tried to speak to them. Known as Nerdanel the Wise, she was strong-willed, free of mind, filled with desire for knowledge, and more patient than her husband. Bore Fëanor seven sons: Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, and Amras, a family size particularly noteworthy among the Eldar who typically have four children or fewer. In the end she became estranged from Fëanor, grieved by his deeds. When he planned to go into exile, she begged him to leave their youngest sons with her, but he refused, and as she predicted, she lost all her children in Middle-earth.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Valier, sister of Oromë and wife of Tulkas. Lithe and fleet of foot, she is swift as an arrow and can outrun the deer who follow her train wherever she goes in the wild. Renowned for her dancing upon the ever-green lawns of Valimar. Her name means "young" in Quenya. Wed Tulkas upon the Isle of Almaren in the Spring of Arda, and danced before the Valar upon the green grass at their wedding feast.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>One of the Aratar, the Queen of the Valar most acquainted with grief and mourning. Sister to Mandos and Irmo. Mourns for every wound that Arda has suffered in the marring of Melkor, and so great was her sorrow during the Music of the Ainur that her song turned to lamentation long before its end, weaving mourning into the themes of the World before it began. Does not weep for herself, and those who hearken to her learn pity and endurance in hope. Grey is her raiment. Dwells alone in the west of Valinor, beyond the bounds of the world, and seldom comes to Valimar where mirth and joy prevail, going often instead to the Halls of Mandos which are near to her dwelling. Among those who learned from her was Olórin, to whom she taught pity and patience. Her name contains the Quenya word for "tear."<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>An Elf-maiden of Doriath, daughter of Galathil. In the year 497 of the First Age, she wedded Dior Eluchíl, heir of King Thingol, and for a time they dwelt by the waterfall of Lanthir Lamath at the base of the Blue Mountains. There she bore three children: twin sons Eluréd and Elurín, and a daughter Elwing. After the murder of King Thingol and the departure of Melian from Doriath, she returned with Dior to Menegroth, where he took up the kingship and she became Queen of Doriath. When Beren and Lúthien sent the Silmaril in the Nauglamír to Dior before their final passing, its possession drew the wrath of the Sons of Fëanor. In Yule of the year 506, the Sons of Fëanor assaulted Menegroth in the Second Kinslaying, seeking to reclaim the jewel. Both Dior and Nimloth were slain defending their realm, though their daughter Elwing escaped to the Havens of Sirion bearing the Silmaril with her.The Deep Elves or Wise, the second of the three kindreds of the Eldar, descending from the Tatyar who accepted the summons to Aman. Most skilled among the Elves in crafts and lore, they were beloved of Aulë the Smith who taught them much. Generally possessing dark hair of brown or black, they were led by Finwë to Valinor where they founded the great city of Tirion. Their insatiable thirst for knowledge and creation would eventually lead to their rebellion and return to Middle-earth in pursuit of the Silmarils.A great island kingdom of the Second Age, the realm of the Dúnedain, set in the Great Sea between Middle-earth and Aman. The land was raised from the sea by Ossë as a gift to the Edain, and it was called Elenna, the Starwards, because the Edain were led to it by the Star of Eärendil and because the island was shaped like a five-pointed star. Its promontories were Forostar, Andustar, Hyarnustar, Hyarrostar, and Orrostar, with the central region of Mittalmar and the holy mountain Meneltarma at its heart. Númenor had only two rivers, Siril and Nunduinë, and its chief city was Armenelos, alongside ports such as Andúnië and Rómenna.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Teleri">Teleri</a><br><br>Lord of Alqualondë and king of the Teleri in Aman, also known as the Falmari. Younger brother of Elwë, who became Thingol of Doriath. Led the Teleri who completed the Great Journey to Valinor after his brother disappeared in Beleriand. Built Alqualondë, the greatest city of the Teleri on the shores of Aman. Father of Eärwen who wed Finarfin. When Fëanor sought ships to pursue Morgoth to Middle-earth, Olwë rebuked his folly and refused to give him the ships of the Teleri, which they valued as the Noldor did their gems. Fëanor then led his forces to take the ships by force, resulting in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, the first kinslaying among the Eldar. When Thingol learned of the slaying of Olwë's people, he banned the Noldorin language and forbade the Noldor to enter Doriath, save the House of Finarfin whose children were his closest kin through Eärwen.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>The wisest of the Maiar, a servant to both Manwë and Varda. In his youth he dwelt in Lórien, but his ways often took him to the house of Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. Later he would be sent to Middle-earth as one of the Istari in the Third Age, and alone among that order would remain true to his mission.Creatures of Morgoth, twisted and corrupted beings created by the Dark Lord as foot soldiers in his wars against Elves and Men. According to some accounts, the first Orcs were made by capturing Elves and torturing them in the darkness until they were transformed into these monstrous forms, though their true origin remained a matter of debate among the wise. Bred for malice and destruction, they served the purposes of darkness throughout the ages.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Son of Angrod and lord of the Noldor, a dynast of the House of Finarfin. Served as warden of Minas Tirith under his uncle Finrod until the fortress was overrun by Sauron. When Finrod joined Beren in the quest for the Silmaril, he handed rule of Nargothrond to Orodreth. Became King of Nargothrond after Finrod's death. Father of Gil-galad according to later writings, though his parentage was presented differently in the published Silmarillion. Ruled Nargothrond until its fall.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Huntsman of the Valar and the Great Rider, one of the Aratar. Hunter of monsters and evil creatures, riding upon his white steed Nahar and blowing his great horn Valaróma, whose sound is like the upgoing of the Sun in scarlet or the sheer lightning cleaving the clouds. Loves horses and hounds, and all trees and forests. In Yavanna's woods in Valinor he trains his folk and beasts for the hunting of the fell creatures of Melkor. Brother of Nessa and husband of Vána the Ever-young. First among the Valar to discover the Elves at their awakening by the waters of Cuiviénen, and he loved the Children of Ilúvatar before they were yet fully born. Called Aldaron, Lord of Forests, and Tauron by the Sindar.A wooded region of eastern Beleriand between the Ered Luin and the River Gelion, bounded by Ascar to the north and Adurant to the south, named for the seven rivers that watered it. It was settled by the Nandor under Denethor, who became known as the Green elves, skilled in woodcraft and secrecy; the Noldor called the land Lindon, the Land of Music, for the singing heard across the Gelion. Elm trees were plentiful, and the region remained lightly peopled and largely untouched by the great wars, later surviving the War of Wrath as the remnant land known afterward as Lindon.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia vassal of Ulmo, spirit of the seas who loves the winds and prefers the coasts and isles of Middle-earth to the deeps. Spouse of Uinen. During the early days of Arda, he was seduced and turned to Melkor for a time, and some darkness and violence entered his spirit. He enjoys raging in storms despite the will of Ulmo, and only Uinen can restrain his wild urges. She brought him back to loyalty to Ulmo. The best known of the Maiar to the Elves, he maintained a special friendship with the Teleri, teaching them sea-craft. In the Second Age he raised the island of Númenor from the depths.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Oromë, friend of Alatar who took him along when chosen for the mission to Middle-earth as one of the Istari. The two journeyed together into the far East and South of Middle-earth, where they labored to contest the will of Sauron among the peoples of those lands. Their fate remained largely unknown in the West. In some accounts also called Rómestámo, meaning East-helper.The great mountain fence of Aman, raised by the Valar after the destruction of Almaren to defend their new realm against Melkor. The range forms the eastern wall of Valinor, with the Light of the Two Trees shining behind it while the narrow shores at its eastern feet lay in shadow. The tallest peak is Taniquetil, where the mansions of Manwë and Varda stand; the second highest is Hyarmentir above Avathar. The Valar later cut the Calacirya through the mountains so the Light could reach Eldamar and Tol Eressëa, and the mountains were raised higher during the Nurtalë Valinóreva.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>A loremaster of the Noldor, born in Nevrast to a Sindarin and a Noldorin parent, whose name in Sindarin means "teaching sage" or "doctor of lore." When Turgon built Gondolin, he moved with the people there and became one of its great scholars. Member of the Lambengolmor, the society of linguists and historians of which Rúmil and Fëanor were also members. His Quenya name was Quendingoldo or Quengoldo. Credited with authoring many works that became the basis for later chronicles of the Elder Days, preserving accounts of the ancient history of the Elves and the First Age. Survived the Fall of Gondolin and dwelt in Middle-earth through the Second Age. During the War of the Elves and Sauron, after the fall of Eregion, he departed Middle-earth for Tol Eressëa, last of the Loremasters to leave. In later ages, he accepted Ælfwine the traveler from mortal lands and taught him the lore of the Elves and the history of the Elder Days, thus preserving the ancient knowledge.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Lord of the House of the Hammer of Wrath, one of the twelve houses of Gondolin. His house recruited heavily from Noldor who had escaped from Morgoth's mines and nursed a deep hatred for the Dark Enemy and his Balrogs. Great smiths and craftsmen, they revered Aulë above all other Valar. In battle they wielded great maces like hammers and bore heavy shields, for they possessed strong arms. Their device was the Stricken Anvil with a hammer smiting sparks about it, rendered in red, gold, and black iron. During the Fall of Gondolin, his house charged forth and slew a great number of fire-drakes and Balrogs, becoming the first among Elves and Men to slay one of the demons of flame. Seeing no way to retreat, Rog led his warriors outside the city walls where they were surrounded. Every member of the House of the Hammer perished in that last stand, including Rog himself, but their deeds were long remembered in song.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>A Noldorin sage of Tirion, one of the Lambengolmor, the Loremasters of the Noldor, and the first deviser of written characters among the Elves. In the days of bliss in Valinor, he invented a writing system fitting for recording speech and song, creating letters both for graving upon metal or stone and for drawing with brush or pen. His alphabet was called the Tengwar of Rúmil, or Sarati, meaning "letters," as each character was called a sarat. This system was later expanded and perfected by Fëanor into the Tengwar of Fëanor, more commonly known simply as Tengwar. Very learned in languages, he studied the secret tongue of the Valar through the teaching of Aulë. To him is attributed the authorship of the earliest annals and lore of the Elder Days, including accounts of the Ainulindalë and the early history of Arda. His chronicles preserved the oldest traditions of the creation of the world and the doings of the Valar and Eldar in the ancient days.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Nandor">Nandor</a><br><br>A counsellor at the court of King Thingol in Doriath, descended from the Guest-elves, those of the Green-elves or Nandor who sought refuge in the hidden kingdom following the death of their lord Denethor in the First Battle of Beleriand. His father Ithilbor was chief of the Guest-elves and held a permanent seat in Thingol's council. In his pride, Saeros begrudged the honor and esteem that King Thingol showed to Túrin Turambar, the mortal who had become the king's foster son, and spoke contemptuously of him and his people. One evening in the halls of Menegroth, his provocations drove Túrin to cast a drinking vessel at his face, wounding him. The next day Saeros attacked Túrin in the forest, but was defeated and humiliated. Fleeing in shame and terror, he attempted to leap across the ravine of the stream Esgalduin but his footing failed on the far side, and he fell back upon a rock in the water and was killed. His death precipitated Túrin's departure from Doriath and set in motion further tragedy.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of the people of Ulmo who entered Arda with his lord. Maker of the Ulumúri, the great horns of Ulmo wrought of white conch shells. When Ulmo sounds these horns, they produce the music of the sea which echoes in the abyss and can never afterward be forgotten by those who hear it.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of Aulë the Smith, mightiest of that Vala's people, originally called Mairon meaning "The Admirable" in Quenya. From Aulë he learned much of smithing and handiwork, becoming a great craftsman and mighty in lore. Coveting power through which he would coordinate all things according to his own will, he was ensnared by Melkor in the Spring of Arda and became his spy. He left the Blessed Realm for Middle-earth and bent the knee before Melkor as his greatest and most trusted servant. By the time the Elves awoke, he had command over the stronghold of Angband as Melkor's lieutenant. After Morgoth made his great fortress, he appointed this Maia to be its commander. Later took the name Sauron, and after Morgoth's defeat he did not return for judgment but hid in Middle-earth.Men, the younger children of Ilúvatar who awoke in Middle-earth millennia after the Elves, when the Sun first rose in the heavens. So named by the Firstborn to distinguish the two races of the Children, though the Secondborn were granted gifts and destinies different from their elder kindred, including the mystery of mortality and freedom from the circles of the world.The Grey-elves, those Teleri who began the Great Journey to Valinor but remained in Beleriand, never crossing the sea to the Blessed Realm. Many stayed to search for their lord Thingol who had disappeared, enchanted by Melian in the forests of Nan Elmoth. Under Thingol and Melian they established the great kingdom of Doriath and other realms in Beleriand, becoming a mighty people skilled in song and starlight, though they had never seen the Light of the Two Trees. They developed their own culture and language, distinct from both the Avari and the Calaquendi.The principal river of Beleriand, running from the Eithel Sirion beneath the Ered Wethrin southward to the Bay of Balar, and for much of its length forming the border between East and West Beleriand. From its source it passed through the Fen of Serech and the narrow Pass of Sirion between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath, then continued south past Brethil and Doriath before plunging underground at the Falls of Sirion in the Andram and emerging at the Gates of Sirion. It flowed through Nan tathren to its mouths, receiving many tributaries including the Taeglin, Esgalduin, Aros, and Narog. The river’s crossings and islands, such as Tol Sirion, were strategic points in the wars of the First Age.A tributary of Sirion, rising in the Ered Wethrin and flowing southeast through Brethil before joining Sirion on the borders of Doriath. In its upper course it ran through the Ravines of Taeglin along the forest’s edge, and farther south it could be forded at the Crossings of Taeglin. A road ran through the valley from Nargothrond toward Minas Tirith, making it a route of travel and war. The name reflects a sense of boundary, and earlier writings used the form Teiglin before the later spelling Taeglin was adopted.The highest peak of the Pelóri and the tallest mountain in Arda, a holy mountain in central Aman. On its summit stood Ilmarin, the mansions of Manwë and Varda, from which they looked out over the world. The mountain bore many names, including Oiolossë, Ever snow white, and Amon Uilos, White Mountain, and its Quenya name is glossed as High White Peak or High snow peak. It was raised in Aman in the Valian Years and became a symbol of the West’s majesty and the seat of the highest authority among the Valar.The third and most numerous of the three kindreds of the Eldar, descending from the Nelyar who accepted the summons to Aman. During the Great Journey they became most scattered and divided, as many of their number turned aside or remained behind. Those who completed the journey to Valinor became the Falmari, master mariners of the coast of Eldamar, while those who remained in Middle-earth became the Sindar under Thingol. The Nandor who turned back at the Misty Mountains and the Laiquendi who later entered Beleriand were also of Telerin origin.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Sindar">Sindar</a><br><br>Originally called Elwë, one of the two leaders of the Teleri during the Great Journey from Cuiviénen, along with his younger brother Olwë. When the Teleri reached Beleriand, he went wandering in the forest of Nan Elmoth and encountered Melian, one of the Maiar. They fell in love and stood spellbound for years. Alone among the Children of Ilúvatar, he married one of the Ainur. Awakening from the spell, he returned to his people and founded the kingdom of Doriath in the midst of Beleriand. Melian used her power to create the Girdle of Melian, a barrier of bewilderment around the realm. Known thereafter as Elu Thingol in Sindarin, he became High King of the Sindar and nominal Overlord of Beleriand. His subjects became the Grey-elves, speaking Sindarin. Father of Lúthien Tinúviel with Melian. Learned of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë of his brother's people and thereafter banned the Noldorin tongue and forbade the Noldor from entering Doriath, save the House of Finarfin who were his kin through Eärwen.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>A Maia of the people of Oromë, a young hunter of that Vala's company who bore a silver bow. In the days of the Two Trees he hunted in the forests of Valinor. After the destruction of the Trees, when Telperion yielded one last silver flower, the Valar chose Tilion to guide the vessel of the Moon through the heavens. He was not as strong as Arien who guided the Sun, and he loved her, following her through the night sky. When he occasionally drew too near in his pursuit, his vessel became singed by her heat, and thus the Moon waxes and wanes in its course.The city of the Eldar in Eldamar, built on the green hill of Túna within the Calacirya, the only pass through the Pelóri. Its white walls and terraces crowned the hill, and its streets were said to be strewn with white sand like grains of diamond, with crystal stairs rising to its gates. The city was dominated by Ingwë’s tower, the Mindon Eldaliéva, whose light shone far out to sea, and by the Great Square where the white tree Galathilion grew. It was ruled first by Ingwë and later by Finwë, and it became the greatest Elvish city of Aman, a symbol of Eldarin craft and memory.The Lonely Island off the coast of Valinor in the Bay of Eldamar, surrounded by the Enchanted Isles, an arrowhead-shaped green land whose name reflects its original isolation in the midst of Belegaer. Ulmo moved it back and forth across the sea to ferry the Elves to Aman, and afterward it was anchored just off Aman’s eastern shore. The island became the dwelling of the Teleri of Aman, and later a home for many Eldar who returned from Middle-earth at the end of the First Age. Its principal city is Avallónë on the eastern shore, and light from the Calacirya made its lands fertile and fair, with the West visible beyond the sea.Unintelligent humanoid creatures created by Morgoth before the First Age as servants and instruments of destruction. Made as mockeries of the Ents, though without the wisdom or nobility of Yavanna's shepherds, they served the Dark Lord's purposes in war and terror. Strong and brutal but slow of wit, they were vulnerable to sunlight which turned them to stone.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Champion of Valinor, greatest of the Valar in strength and deeds of prowess. Delights in wrestling and contests of strength, and needs no weapon or steed for he is so strong and swift in combat. His hair and beard are golden, his flesh ruddy, and his laughter ever joyous. Came last to Arda among the Valar, answering the call when Melkor's violence grew too great, and his coming turned the tide of battle. In the Battle of the Powers, after the long siege of Utumno, he wrestled with Melkor and cast him upon his face, binding him in the chain Angainor. Wed Nessa the sister of Oromë upon the Isle of Almaren in the Spring of Arda, in a great feast where she danced before all the Valar. His weapons are his hands, slow to wrath but slow also to forget an injury.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Second son of Fingolfin, younger brother of Fingon and elder brother of Aredhel and Argon, making him second in line to succeed as High King of the Noldor. In Aman he married Elenwë of the Vanyar, and they had a daughter, Idril Celebrindal. During the crossing of the Helcaraxë, Elenwë fell into the bitter waters and was lost, though Turgon saved their daughter. Guided by visions from Ulmo, he discovered the hidden valley of Tumladen and there founded Gondolin, the Hidden City, building it in secret over many years. The city remained concealed from both friend and foe by the Encircling Mountains and guarded by the Eagles of Thorondor. Upon the death of his brother Fingon at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he became High King of the Noldor, the third to bear that title in Middle-earth. He ruled Gondolin for nearly four hundred years, until the city was betrayed by Maeglin and destroyed by Morgoth's forces. He died defending his Tower during the Fall of Gondolin, the last of the great Noldorin realms to endure against the Dark Enemy.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Maiar">Maiar</a><br><br>Lady of the Seas, a Maia of Ulmo and spouse of Ossë. Loves and protects all creatures and weeds that live in the sea, and brings calm to the waters. She alone can restrain the tumultuous waves and wild urges of Ossë, and for this power she is loved by mariners. When Ossë turned to Melkor during the early days of Arda, it was Uinen who brought him back to loyalty to Ulmo. With Ossë, she was among the best known of the Maiar to the Elves.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Lord of Waters and King of the Sea, one of the Aratar and third in majesty after Manwë and Varda. All waters are under his government, from the great ocean Ekkaia to bays and rivers and even the waters under the earth. His spirit runs in all the veins of the world. Dwells not in Valinor but alone in the Outer Ocean, moving as he will in all the deep waters about the Earth or under the Earth, having no need of any resting place. Before the creation of Arda, when the Ainur sang before Ilúvatar, he was the best singer and maker of music among them. Speaks through the sound of water, and makes music through his great horns the Ulumúri, wrought of white shell. His voice is deep as the deepest of the seas. When he rises from the deeps, he appears dreadful and terrible as a mounting wave that strides to the land, clad in silver-green mail and wearing a helm dark and foam-crested. Loves both Elves and Men and never forsook them, sending messages through waters and dreams even when the Valar withdrew their aid.Melkor’s first and greatest fortress, built after his arrival in Arda beneath the Iron Mountains where the light of the Two Lamps was dim and cold. From this stronghold the blight of his hatred spread and the Spring of Arda was marred. It was delved exceedingly deep, with pits of fire, caverns, and vaults hidden with deceit, and it housed great hosts of servants; the far north became desolate under its shadow. It served as Melkor’s base until the Valar assailed it, broke its gates, and unroofed it, taking Melkor captive to Valinor. Angband began as a lesser fortress to the west of Utumno and later became its successor.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Weaver, one of the Valier and spouse of Námo who dwells with him in the Halls of Mandos. Weaves all things that have ever been in Time into her storied webs, and the halls that ever widen as the ages pass are clothed with her tapestries depicting all events of unfolding history. The walls of those vast chambers are lined with her work, recording every deed and moment from the beginning of Arda. Her name means "Weaver" or "Ever-weaving" in Quenya, derived from the root meaning "wind" or "weave." Míriel Þerindë entered her service after returning to life, recording the deeds of the House of Finwë in thread and cloth.The Powers of the World, the mightiest of the Ainur who entered Arda to complete its material development after the Music of the Ainur determined its form. Fourteen great spirits took up this responsibility, becoming the shapers and rulers of the world, each with particular dominion over aspects of creation. Dwelling in the Blessed Realm of Valinor in the Uttermost West, they guided the destiny of Arda and summoned the Elves to dwell with them in the light of the Two Trees.The City of Many Bells at the heart of Valinor, where many of the Valar and Maiar dwelt. It lay near Ezellohar, the green mound where the Two Trees grew, on the Girdle of Arda in the east-central Plains of Valinor, west of Taniquetil. The city is described as a place of splendor, with houses roofed in gold, floors of silver, and doors of polished bronze, their stones lifted with spells and bound with magic. Its name means the dwelling of the Valar, emphasizing its role as the central habitation of the Powers in the Blessed Realm.The realm of the Valar in central Aman, established after Almaren was destroyed and properly referring to the inhabited lands of the continent. It was home to the Valar and to the Vanyar, Noldor, and some of the Teleri, with Valimar as its central city and Tol Eressëa lying just off its eastern shore. The Pelóri were raised to the east as a defense against Melkor, while Ekkaia lay to the west, and the land was hallowed and stainless, free from sickness or decay. The Two Trees grew on Ezellohar and lit the realm, and the great Elvish cities of Tirion and Alqualondë were built there.The Fair Elves, the first and smallest of the three kindreds of the Eldar, descending from all the Minyar who accepted the summons to Valinor. All among them possessed golden hair, and they were the most beloved of Manwë and Varda, dwelling upon Taniquetil and in the plains of Valinor. Led by Ingwë, they were first to arrive in the Blessed Realm and never departed from it save when they marched to war against Morgoth in the final battle of the First Age.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>Queen of the Valar and Lady of the Stars, one of the Aratar. Wife of Manwë and mightiest of the Valier, dwelling with him upon Taniquetil. Called Elbereth Gilthoniel by the Elves in Sindarin, and Elentári, Star-Queen, in Quenya. Too great is her beauty to be declared in words of Men or Elves, for the light of Ilúvatar lives still in her face, and in light is her power and her joy. Knows all the regions of Eä and rejoices in light. Filled the Two Lamps with radiance during the Spring of Arda. Before the awakening of the Elves, she undertook her greatest work: taking the dew from the vats of Telperion, she created new and brighter stars, setting many individual stars and also constellations, including Carnil, Luinil, Nénar, Lumbar, Alcarinquë, Elemmírë, and the Sickle of the Valar. Together with Manwë she sees beyond all eyes through mist and darkness, and with him hears all voices from every corner of the world. In Middle-earth she is most revered by the Elves, who call upon her name and sing hymns to her. The very mention of her name is said to be deadly to evil spirits. Her name Varda means "Sublime," "Exalted," or "Lofty" in Quenya.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Noldor">Noldor</a><br><br>Voronwë Aranwion, called the Steadfast, a mariner of Gondolin and son of Aranwë, a nobleman related to the House of Fingolfin. His mother was one of the Sindar of the Falas, descended from the people of Círdan, thus he had both Noldorin and Sindarin heritage. After the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, King Turgon sent seven ships into the West seeking aid from the Valar, and Voronwë sailed on one of these vessels. All the ships were destroyed in storms, and he alone survived of all the mariners. By the grace of Ulmo, Lord of Waters, he was saved from drowning and cast ashore at Vinyamar in Nevrast, where he encountered Tuor son of Huor. Recognizing that Ulmo's will was at work, Voronwë agreed to guide Tuor through the wastes and perils of Beleriand to the hidden entrance of Gondolin, a journey of great danger. Without his knowledge of the land and his steadfast guidance, Tuor could never have found the Hidden City, and thus he played a crucial role in the salvation of those who escaped the Fall of Gondolin.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Ever-young, one of the Valier. Younger sister of Yavanna and spouse of Oromë. Possesses influence over the flora and fauna of Middle-earth. All flowers spring as she passes and open if she glances upon them, and all birds sing at her coming. Dwells in gardens filled with golden flowers, and often comes to the forests of Oromë. The Maia Arien tended the golden flowers of her gardens, watering them with the bright dews from Laurelin in the days of the Two Trees. Melian also served Vána and Estë before departing to Middle-earth. Her name means "beautiful" in Quenya, related to unmarred beauty.<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Valar">Valar</a><br><br>The Giver of Fruits and Queen of the Earth, one of the Aratar. Called Kementári, meaning Queen of the Earth. Elder sister of Vána and spouse of Aulë, with whom she dwells in central Valinor. Lover of all things that grow in the earth, holding countless forms in her mind, from the trees like towers in forests long ago to the moss upon stones and the small secret things in the mould. All growing things answer to her, both the olvar that are rooted in place and the kelvar that move freely. In reverence she is next to Varda among the Queens of the Valar. Her usual form is that of a tall woman robed in green, though at times she takes other shapes. Some have seen her standing like a tree under heaven, crowned with the Sun and with roots plunging into the waters beneath. From her thoughts came the shapes of the Two Trees of Valinor, Telperion and Laurelin. At her request, Eru gave life to the Ents as shepherds of the trees. Her name means "Giver of Fruits" in Quenya.Those not of Aman, the term the Noldorin Exiles used to describe those Eldar who set out on the Great Journey but remained in Middle-earth without completing it. This geographic designation particularly applied to the Sindar, but could encompass the Laiquendi and more broadly all the Nandor. The term arose as a more polite alternative to Moriquendi when the returning Noldor found that the Sindar were offended by being classified among the Elves of Darkness, despite their Grey-elven nobility and the greatness of their kingdoms.
