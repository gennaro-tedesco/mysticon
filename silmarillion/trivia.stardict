Great Journey|Great March	The westward migration of the Elves from Cuiviénen to Aman, begun at the summons of the Valar so the Eldar might dwell nearer their protection and wisdom, and so the Valar themselves might enjoy the beauty of the Firstborn. Oromë led the three clans across Middle-earth and to the Great Sea, with Ossë aiding the sea-crossing. The march produced the Sundering of the Elves, dividing the original kindreds according to who completed the journey, who turned aside, and who refused the summons. Those who reached Aman became the Amanyar, including the Vanyar and Noldor and the Falmari among the Teleri, while those who remained in Middle-earth were the Úmanyar, including the Sindar and Nandor, and those who never departed were the Avari. The journey culminated in the founding of Eldamar and reshaped Elvish history by creating lasting cultural and geographic divisions.
Kinslaying|Kinslayings	A term for the three instances in which Elves fought and slew other Elves, all committed by the Noldor in the course of the quest to recover the Silmarils. The First Kinslaying, also called the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, took place when the Noldor seized the Telerin ships by force and Teleri were killed. The Second Kinslaying contributed to the fall of Doriath and was fought over the Silmaril held by Dior. The Third Kinslaying occurred at the Mouths of Sirion over the Silmaril borne by Elwing, and it was considered the worst of the three. These events became enduring tragedies in Eldarin memory and are treated collectively as defining wounds among the Eldar.
Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears	The fifth battle of the Wars of Beleriand, fought between the forces of Morgoth and the Union of Maedhros, and named for the words of the Doom of Mandos: “Tears unnumbered ye shall shed.” After the Dagor Bragollach, the Noldor had lost the entire north and were largely reduced to Hithlum and Nargothrond, and the Union attempted a coordinated offensive to break Morgoth’s power. The plan divided the Union into two hosts, a western host under Fingon and an eastern host under Maedhros, hoping to strike like hammer and anvil when a beacon was lit in Dorthonion; Turgon came unexpectedly with a host from Gondolin. Morgoth learned of the plan through spies, and treachery among Men ruined the coordination. The battle ended in heavy losses for the Elves, leaving Morgoth dominant over Beleriand. The slain were piled into Haudh‑en‑Nirnaeth, the Hill of the Slain, and the defeat shaped the grim course of the remaining First Age.
Two Lamps|Lamps of the Valar	The first great lights of Arda in the Spring of Arda: Illuin in the far north and Ormal in the far south. They were wrought by Aulë at Yavanna’s request so that her planted seeds could grow, filled with light by Varda, and hallowed by Manwë. Each lamp was set on a mighty pillar taller than any later mountains, with Illuin shining a blue light from Helcar in the north and Ormal shining a golden light from Ringil in the south. Where their lights mingled, the Great Lake and the island Almaren lay, and there the Valar first dwelt; the world was lit as if in a changeless day. Melkor later cast down the pillars and broke the Lamps, shattering the symmetry of Arda, forming new seas, and driving the Valar to retreat to Aman, where they later made the Two Trees.
