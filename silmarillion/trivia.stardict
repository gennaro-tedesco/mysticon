Awakening	The coming into being of the Quendi at Cuiviénen in the Year of the Trees 1050, marking the beginning of the First Age. The first Elves awoke by the shores of the inland Sea of Helcar in the far east of Middle-earth at the moment Varda finished kindling new stars in the night sky. According to tradition, the first word spoken by the Elves was ele, meaning behold, as they gazed upon the stars. The first to awaken were three pairs: Imin the First with Iminyë, Tata the Second with Tatië, and Enel the Third with Enelyë. They dwelt by the starlit waters of Cuiviénen for many Valian Years before Oromë discovered them and the Valar summoned them to Aman. The Awakening is recounted in the Cuivienyarna and represents the beginning of Elvish history and the fulfillment of Ilúvatar's design for the Firstborn Children.
Darkening of Valinor	The destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor by Melkor and Ungoliant in Valian Year 1495, ending the Years of the Trees and plunging Aman into darkness. Melkor, seeking vengeance against the Valar and coveting the Silmarils, allied with Ungoliant, a primeval spirit of darkness in spider form who dwelt in Avathar. She shrouded them both in her Unlight, webs of impenetrable darkness that even the eyes of Manwë could not pierce, and together they came unseen to Ezellohar during a festival when the Valar were gathered. There Melkor struck both Telperion and Laurelin with his great spear, wounding them and causing their sap to pour forth, and Ungoliant drank greedily from the Trees, draining their light and poisoning them with her venom until they withered and died. The radiance of Valinor was extinguished, and darkness fell upon the Blessed Realm for the first time since the making of the Trees. In that same hour Melkor fled north to Formenos and murdered Finwë, stealing the Silmarils, while Ungoliant's insatiable thirst swelled her to monstrous size. The five Valian Years between the Darkening and the rising of the Sun became known as the Long Night, a time of mourning and shadow. Yavanna and Nienna tried in vain to heal the Trees, but they were beyond restoration, and only one silver flower of Telperion and one golden fruit of Laurelin remained, from which the Valar later fashioned the Moon and Sun. The Darkening marked the end of the Elder Days of Valinor and set in motion the exile of the Noldor, the Wars of Beleriand, and all the sorrows that followed from the Oath of Fëanor.
Great Journey|Great March	The westward migration of the Elves from Cuiviénen to Aman, begun at the summons of the Valar so the Eldar might dwell nearer their protection and wisdom, and so the Valar themselves might enjoy the beauty of the Firstborn. Oromë led the three clans across Middle-earth and to the Great Sea, with Ossë aiding the sea-crossing. The march produced the Sundering of the Elves, dividing the original kindreds according to who completed the journey, who turned aside, and who refused the summons. Those who reached Aman became the Amanyar, including the Vanyar and Noldor and the Falmari among the Teleri, while those who remained in Middle-earth were the Úmanyar, including the Sindar and Nandor, and those who never departed were the Avari. The journey culminated in the founding of Eldamar and reshaped Elvish history by creating lasting cultural and geographic divisions.
Illuin	One of the Two Lamps of the Valar, the northern lamp that lit Middle-earth during the Spring of Arda before the creation of the Two Trees. Wrought by Aulë, filled with light by Varda, and hallowed by Manwë, Illuin was set upon the great pillar of Helcar in the far north and shone with a blue light over the northern lands. Its pillar was taller than any mountain of the later ages, and where its light mingled with that of Ormal in the south, the lands were fairest and richest in growth. When Melkor cast down the pillar in ancient days, Illuin fell and its breaking created the inland Sea of Helcar, ending the Spring of Arda and bringing darkness and ruin to the Valar's first dwelling. The name may derive from il, sky, and luin, blue, reflecting the lamp's azure radiance.
Kinslaying|Kinslayings	A term for the three instances in which Elves fought and slew other Elves, all committed by the Noldor in the course of the quest to recover the Silmarils. The First Kinslaying, also called the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, took place when the Noldor seized the Telerin ships by force and Teleri were killed. The Second Kinslaying contributed to the fall of Doriath and was fought over the Silmaril held by Dior. The Third Kinslaying occurred at the Mouths of Sirion over the Silmaril borne by Elwing, and it was considered the worst of the three. These events became enduring tragedies in Eldarin memory and are treated collectively as defining wounds among the Eldar.
Laurelin|Golden Tree	The younger of the Two Trees of Valinor, called the Golden Tree, which shed golden light upon the realm of the Valar. Her leaves were edged with gold and she bore countless flowers of yellow flame upon her branches, and from her boughs fell a rain of golden dew that Varda collected in her wells. Laurelin bloomed during the second half of each Valian day, following the waning of Telperion, and her light was warm and rich like sunlight, while Telperion's was cool and silver. She grew on Ezellohar outside the gates of Valimar, watered by the tears of Nienna, and was considered the female counterpart to Telperion. When Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the Trees in the Darkening of Valinor, one last fruit of Laurelin survived, and from this the Valar fashioned the Sun, carried aloft by the Maia Arien. Her Sindarin names included Galadlóriel, Glewellin meaning song of gold, Lasgalen meaning green of leaf, and Melthinorn meaning tree of gold.
Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears	The fifth battle of the Wars of Beleriand, fought between the forces of Morgoth and the Union of Maedhros, and named for the words of the Doom of Mandos: "Tears unnumbered ye shall shed." After the Dagor Bragollach, the Noldor had lost the entire north and were largely reduced to Hithlum and Nargothrond, and the Union attempted a coordinated offensive to break Morgoth's power. The plan divided the Union into two hosts, a western host under Fingon and an eastern host under Maedhros, hoping to strike like hammer and anvil when a beacon was lit in Dorthonion; Turgon came unexpectedly with a host from Gondolin. Morgoth learned of the plan through spies, and treachery among Men ruined the coordination. The battle ended in heavy losses for the Elves, leaving Morgoth dominant over Beleriand. The slain were piled into Haudh‑en‑Nirnaeth, the Hill of the Slain, and the defeat shaped the grim course of the remaining First Age.
Oath of Fëanor	The terrible and irrevocable oath sworn by Fëanor and his seven sons at Tirion after learning of the theft of the Silmarils and the murder of Finwë, binding them to pursue with vengeance and hatred anyone in Arda, whether Vala, Elf, Man, Maia, or even one of their own kin, who should take or withhold a Silmaril from them. Fëanor spoke the oath in the name of Ilúvatar, calling upon Manwë and Varda as witnesses and invoking everlasting darkness upon himself and his sons should they fail or falter, and his seven sons, Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, and the twins Amrod and Amras, swore the same dreadful vow. The oath became a curse upon the House of Fëanor, driving them to commit kinslaying and atrocity in their relentless pursuit of the jewels: the First Kinslaying at Alqualondë where they slew the Teleri for their ships, the Second Kinslaying at Doriath where they attacked Dior Eluchíl and his people, and the Third Kinslaying at the Mouths of Sirion where they assaulted the refugees led by Elwing. The oath bound them even beyond death, as Mandos would not release the spirits of the sons of Fëanor from his halls while their oath remained unfulfilled. Of the seven sons, only Maedhros and Maglor survived to see the end of the First Age, and when they seized the last two Silmarils after the War of Wrath, the jewels burned their hands in judgment of their evil deeds. In despair, Maedhros cast himself with his Silmaril into a fiery chasm, and Maglor threw his into the sea, thus ending the oath in tragedy and loss. The Oath of Fëanor stands as one of the great calamities of the Elder Days, a rash vow that brought ruin to its swearers and to countless innocents, and its shadow fell upon all the long years of the Wars of Beleriand.
Silmarils	The three supreme jewels of Arda, wrought by Fëanor in Aman during the Years of the Trees from the crystalline substance silima, into which he captured and preserved the mingled light of Telperion and Laurelin. The Silmarils shone with their own inner light, brighter than the stars, and were the most beautiful works ever made by the Children of Ilúvatar, surpassing all other gems in radiance and holiness. Fëanor gave his heart to their making and could never duplicate them, and after the Darkening of Valinor they alone contained the last unmarred light of the Two Trees. Varda hallowed the Silmarils so that no mortal flesh nor any hands defiled by evil could touch them without being scorched and withered, making them sacred and untouchable to the unworthy. When Melkor murdered Finwë and stole the jewels from Formenos, Fëanor and his seven sons swore the terrible Oath of Fëanor, vowing to pursue anyone who withheld a Silmaril from them, even unto everlasting darkness, and this oath brought ruin and kinslaying upon the Noldor. The theft ignited the Wars of Beleriand and the long struggle against Morgoth, who set the Silmarils in his Iron Crown though they burned his hands black. Beren and Lúthien recovered one Silmaril from Morgoth's crown, and it passed through Dior and Elwing to Eärendil, who bore it on his brow as he sailed the skies as a star of hope. After the War of Wrath, Maedhros and Maglor seized the two remaining Silmarils, but found themselves burned by them due to their evil deeds, and in anguish Maedhros cast himself and his jewel into a chasm of fire while Maglor threw his into the sea. Thus the three Silmarils endure forever sundered: one in the heavens with Eärendil, one in the fires of the earth, and one in the depths of the sea, their light present in all the elements but beyond the reach of mortal hands.
Ormal	One of the Two Lamps of the Valar, the southern lamp that lit Middle-earth during the Spring of Arda before the creation of the Two Trees. Wrought by Aulë, filled with light by Varda, and hallowed by Manwë, Ormal was set upon the great pillar of Ringil in the far south and shone with a golden light over the southern lands. Its pillar stood taller than any mountain of later ages, and where its golden light mingled with the blue radiance of Illuin in the north, the Great Lake and the Isle of Almaren lay, and there the Valar made their first dwelling. When Melkor cast down the pillar at least five ages before the beginning of the First Age, Ormal fell and its breaking created the Sea of Ringil in the south, ending the Spring of Arda and forcing the Valar to retreat to Aman. The name apparently means Lofty Gold or High Gold, reflecting the lamp's golden radiance.
Spring of Arda	A period of peace and flourishing in Arda during the Days before Days, beginning after the First War ended and the Two Lamps were raised. Yavanna's seeds grew and spread, filling the lands with trees and herbs, beasts and birds, and all the world became green under the light of Illuin in the north and Ormal in the south. At the midmost of Arda lay the Great Lake and the Isle of Almaren, where the light of the Two Lamps mingled and living things were richest in growth and fairest in hue, and there the Valar made their first dwelling and rested after their labors. The Spring endured until Melkor returned in war and cast down the pillars of the Lamps in the 3450th Valian Year, breaking the lands, roiling the seas, and bringing darkness to Middle-earth. The destruction marked the end of the first blissful age and drove the Valar to retreat to Aman, where they later made the Two Trees.
Telperion|White Tree	The elder of the Two Trees of Valinor, called the White Tree or the Silver Tree, which shed silver light upon the realm of the Valar. His leaves were dark green above and shining silver beneath, and his boughs were decked with brilliant flowers that shed a rain of silver dew, collected as a source of water and light. Telperion bloomed during the first half of each Valian day, followed by Laurelin, and his light was cool and pale like moonlight, while Laurelin's was warm and golden. He grew on Ezellohar outside the gates of Valimar, created by Yavanna and watered by the tears of Nienna, and was considered the male counterpart to Laurelin. When Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the Trees in the Darkening of Valinor, one last flower of Telperion survived, and from this the Valar fashioned the Moon, carried aloft by the Maia Tilion. Because the Elves especially loved Telperion, Yavanna made Galathilion, an image of Telperion that stood in Tirion and gave rise to the line of White Trees that descended through Celeborn to Nimloth of Númenor and ultimately to the White Tree of Gondor.
Two Lamps|Lamps of the Valar	The first great lights of Arda in the Spring of Arda: Illuin in the far north and Ormal in the far south. They were wrought by Aulë at Yavanna's request so that her planted seeds could grow, filled with light by Varda, and hallowed by Manwë. Each lamp was set on a mighty pillar taller than any later mountains, with Illuin shining a blue light from Helcar in the north and Ormal shining a golden light from Ringil in the south. Where their lights mingled, the Great Lake and the island Almaren lay, and there the Valar first dwelt; the world was lit as if in a changeless day. Melkor later cast down the pillars and broke the Lamps, shattering the symmetry of Arda, forming new seas, and driving the Valar to retreat to Aman, where they later made the Two Trees.
Two Trees|Two Trees of Valinor	The sacred trees Telperion and Laurelin that brought light to Valinor during the Years of the Trees, after the destruction of the Two Lamps and before the rising of the Sun and Moon. Sung into being by Yavanna on the green mound of Ezellohar outside Valimar, they grew in the presence of all the Valar and were watered by the tears of Nienna. Telperion the elder was silver with dark green leaves shining silver beneath, and Laurelin the younger was golden with gold-edged leaves, and each waxed and waned in turn so that Valinor was never without light. Their mingled radiance upon Aman was holy and beautiful beyond measure, and the true light of the Trees before their poisoning was said to reside only in the Silmarils of Fëanor. In the Darkening of Valinor, Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed both Trees, draining their light and leaving them withered. From their last flower and fruit the Valar made the Moon and Sun, and descendants of Telperion survived as the White Trees of Númenor and Gondor. The destruction of the Two Trees marked the end of an age and the beginning of the First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar.
War of Wrath|Great Battle	The final and greatest conflict of the Wars of Beleriand, fought between the Host of the West sent by the Valar and the forces of Morgoth, lasting more than four decades from the years 545 to 587 of the First Age. Eärendil the Mariner came before the Valar bearing a Silmaril upon his brow and delivered the errand of the Two Kindreds, begging for pardon for the Noldor and for aid against Morgoth's tyranny, and the Valar were moved by his plea and resolved at last to intervene. The Host of the West was gathered in Aman, including the Vanyar who had never come to Middle-earth, the Noldor of Valinor, many of the Maiar, and the host sailed east in the ships of the Falmari while Eärendil rose into the heavens as a living star. When the Host landed in Middle-earth the war was joined, and the struggle was long and devastating, with the shape of the world broken and remade by the fury of the battles. In the final years Morgoth unleashed his last weapon, the winged dragons led by Ancalagon the Black, the mightiest of all dragons, and they drove back the Host of Valinor until Eärendil came in his sky-ship Vingilótë with Thorondor and the great Eagles, and they fought the dragons through the air. After a day-long battle Eärendil slew Ancalagon, and the dragon fell upon Thangorodrim and broke its towers in his ruin. Morgoth fled to the deepest pits of Angband but was dragged forth, and when he sued for pardon his feet were hewn from under him and he was cast down. The Valar bound him with the chain Angainor, took from him the two remaining Silmarils, and thrust him through the Door of Night beyond the Walls of the World into the Timeless Void, never to return until the End of Days. The devastation of the War was so great that most of Beleriand sank beneath the waves of Belegaer, and only Lindon endured in the west. The War of Wrath ended the Elder Days and the long First Age, and the few faithful Edain who survived were given Númenor as their reward, while the exiled Noldor were pardoned and many returned to Valinor.
