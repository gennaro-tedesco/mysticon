Awakening	The coming into being of the Quendi at Cuiviénen in the Year of the Trees 1050, marking the beginning of the First Age. The first Elves awoke by the shores of the inland Sea of Helcar in the far east of Middle-earth at the moment Varda finished kindling new stars in the night sky. According to tradition, the first word spoken by the Elves was ele, meaning behold, as they gazed upon the stars. The first to awaken were three pairs: Imin the First with Iminyë, Tata the Second with Tatië, and Enel the Third with Enelyë. They dwelt by the starlit waters of Cuiviénen for many Valian Years before Oromë discovered them and the Valar summoned them to Aman. The Awakening is recounted in the Cuivienyarna and represents the beginning of Elvish history and the fulfillment of Ilúvatar's design for the Firstborn Children.
Great Journey|Great March	The westward migration of the Elves from Cuiviénen to Aman, begun at the summons of the Valar so the Eldar might dwell nearer their protection and wisdom, and so the Valar themselves might enjoy the beauty of the Firstborn. Oromë led the three clans across Middle-earth and to the Great Sea, with Ossë aiding the sea-crossing. The march produced the Sundering of the Elves, dividing the original kindreds according to who completed the journey, who turned aside, and who refused the summons. Those who reached Aman became the Amanyar, including the Vanyar and Noldor and the Falmari among the Teleri, while those who remained in Middle-earth were the Úmanyar, including the Sindar and Nandor, and those who never departed were the Avari. The journey culminated in the founding of Eldamar and reshaped Elvish history by creating lasting cultural and geographic divisions.
Illuin	One of the Two Lamps of the Valar, the northern lamp that lit Middle-earth during the Spring of Arda before the creation of the Two Trees. Wrought by Aulë, filled with light by Varda, and hallowed by Manwë, Illuin was set upon the great pillar of Helcar in the far north and shone with a blue light over the northern lands. Its pillar was taller than any mountain of the later ages, and where its light mingled with that of Ormal in the south, the lands were fairest and richest in growth. When Melkor cast down the pillar in ancient days, Illuin fell and its breaking created the inland Sea of Helcar, ending the Spring of Arda and bringing darkness and ruin to the Valar's first dwelling. The name may derive from il, sky, and luin, blue, reflecting the lamp's azure radiance.
Kinslaying|Kinslayings	A term for the three instances in which Elves fought and slew other Elves, all committed by the Noldor in the course of the quest to recover the Silmarils. The First Kinslaying, also called the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, took place when the Noldor seized the Telerin ships by force and Teleri were killed. The Second Kinslaying contributed to the fall of Doriath and was fought over the Silmaril held by Dior. The Third Kinslaying occurred at the Mouths of Sirion over the Silmaril borne by Elwing, and it was considered the worst of the three. These events became enduring tragedies in Eldarin memory and are treated collectively as defining wounds among the Eldar.
Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears	The fifth battle of the Wars of Beleriand, fought between the forces of Morgoth and the Union of Maedhros, and named for the words of the Doom of Mandos: "Tears unnumbered ye shall shed." After the Dagor Bragollach, the Noldor had lost the entire north and were largely reduced to Hithlum and Nargothrond, and the Union attempted a coordinated offensive to break Morgoth's power. The plan divided the Union into two hosts, a western host under Fingon and an eastern host under Maedhros, hoping to strike like hammer and anvil when a beacon was lit in Dorthonion; Turgon came unexpectedly with a host from Gondolin. Morgoth learned of the plan through spies, and treachery among Men ruined the coordination. The battle ended in heavy losses for the Elves, leaving Morgoth dominant over Beleriand. The slain were piled into Haudh‑en‑Nirnaeth, the Hill of the Slain, and the defeat shaped the grim course of the remaining First Age.
Ormal	One of the Two Lamps of the Valar, the southern lamp that lit Middle-earth during the Spring of Arda before the creation of the Two Trees. Wrought by Aulë, filled with light by Varda, and hallowed by Manwë, Ormal was set upon the great pillar of Ringil in the far south and shone with a golden light over the southern lands. Its pillar stood taller than any mountain of later ages, and where its golden light mingled with the blue radiance of Illuin in the north, the Great Lake and the Isle of Almaren lay, and there the Valar made their first dwelling. When Melkor cast down the pillar at least five ages before the beginning of the First Age, Ormal fell and its breaking created the Sea of Ringil in the south, ending the Spring of Arda and forcing the Valar to retreat to Aman. The name apparently means Lofty Gold or High Gold, reflecting the lamp's golden radiance.
Spring of Arda	A period of peace and flourishing in Arda during the Days before Days, beginning after the First War ended and the Two Lamps were raised. Yavanna's seeds grew and spread, filling the lands with trees and herbs, beasts and birds, and all the world became green under the light of Illuin in the north and Ormal in the south. At the midmost of Arda lay the Great Lake and the Isle of Almaren, where the light of the Two Lamps mingled and living things were richest in growth and fairest in hue, and there the Valar made their first dwelling and rested after their labors. The Spring endured until Melkor returned in war and cast down the pillars of the Lamps in the 3450th Valian Year, breaking the lands, roiling the seas, and bringing darkness to Middle-earth. The destruction marked the end of the first blissful age and drove the Valar to retreat to Aman, where they later made the Two Trees.
Two Lamps|Lamps of the Valar	The first great lights of Arda in the Spring of Arda: Illuin in the far north and Ormal in the far south. They were wrought by Aulë at Yavanna's request so that her planted seeds could grow, filled with light by Varda, and hallowed by Manwë. Each lamp was set on a mighty pillar taller than any later mountains, with Illuin shining a blue light from Helcar in the north and Ormal shining a golden light from Ringil in the south. Where their lights mingled, the Great Lake and the island Almaren lay, and there the Valar first dwelt; the world was lit as if in a changeless day. Melkor later cast down the pillars and broke the Lamps, shattering the symmetry of Arda, forming new seas, and driving the Valar to retreat to Aman, where they later made the Two Trees.
