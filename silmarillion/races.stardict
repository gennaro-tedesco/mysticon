Ainur	Immortal angelic spirits created by Eru Ilúvatar before the beginning of the World, whose being originated in the Timeless Halls beyond creation. Through the Music of the Ainur, they participated in the vision and shaping of Arda. Those who chose to enter the physical world to complete its material development became known as the Powers of Arda, divided into the mightier Valar and the lesser Maiar. As beings of free will, they could rebel against their creator, as demonstrated by Melkor's fall into darkness.
Amanyar	Those of Aman, a term used by the Noldorin Exiles to describe themselves and those Elves who dwelt in the Blessed Realm of Valinor. The distinction arose after the Flight of the Noldor, when terminology shifted from the older Calaquendi/Moriquendi classification to the more geographically-based Amanyar/Úmanyar division, which proved less offensive to the Sindar who had never seen the Light of the Two Trees.
Aratar	The Exalted or High Ones of Arda, comprising the eight greatest among the Valar: Manwë, Varda, Ulmo, Yavanna, Aulë, Mandos, Nienna, and Oromë. These mightiest of the Powers possessed supreme authority and influence over the shaping and governance of Arda, standing above their peers in majesty and power.
Atani	The Secondborn, the race of mortal Men who awoke in Middle-earth when the Sun first rose in the heavens late in the First Age, millennia after the awakening of the Elves. Unlike the immortal Firstborn, they were granted the gift of mortality and freedom from the circles of the world, though this gift was often perceived as a doom by those who did not understand Eru's design.
Avari	The Refusers or Unwilling, those Quendi who rejected the summons of the Valar and refused to undertake the Great Journey to Valinor. Their initial population included more than one-third of all Elves, evenly divided between the Tatyar and Nelyar kindreds. After their refusal, they fragmented into many separate kindreds with different languages as they spread across Middle-earth, remaining largely outside the histories preserved by the Eldar.
Balrogs	Corrupted Maiar who followed Melkor in his rebellion and were transformed into demons of terror and flame. These powerful spirits of fire and shadow served as Morgoth's most terrible servants, dwelling in the depths of Angband and leading his armies in battle. Their true nature as fallen Ainur made them formidable adversaries even to the mightiest of the Children of Ilúvatar.
Calaquendi	Elves of Light, comprising the Vanyar, Noldor, and those Teleri who completed the Great Journey and beheld the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor in the Blessed Realm. This term distinguished them from the Moriquendi who never saw that sacred light. After the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, the Exiles found this terminology offensive to the Sindar and largely ceased its use except in written lore, preferring the terms Amanyar and Úmanyar instead.
Dragons	Ancient creatures of fire and malice, first brought forth by Morgoth in Angband as weapons of war and terror. Glaurung, Father of Dragons, was the first of the Fire-drakes, combining immense physical power with cunning intelligence and the ability to enchant and deceive through speech and gaze. These serpents of flame became instruments of destruction in the wars of Beleriand.
Dwarves	The children of Aulë the Smith, created by the Vala in his impatience for the awakening of the Children of Ilúvatar, though Eru granted them true life and independent will. Makers and craftsmen of great skill, they were given their own language Khuzdul by their creator. Seven fathers of the Dwarves were made, each founding a great house of their kindred, and they proved themselves steadfast and enduring despite not being among the original designs of Eru.
Eagles	Great Eagles or Eagles of Manwë, immense sentient birds who served as messengers and agents of the Lord of the Winds. Capable of speech and possessed of keen intelligence, these noble creatures aided the Free Peoples in their struggles against the forces of darkness. Led by mighty lords such as Thorondor, they dwelt in the high places of the world and intervened at crucial moments in the wars against Morgoth and his servants.
Edain	The Elf-friends, specifically those Houses of Men who allied with the Elves during the First Age in Beleriand and fought against Morgoth. Distinguished from other Men by their friendship with the Eldar and their valor in the wars of the Silmarils, they were granted the island realm of Númenor as a reward for their faithfulness. The term particularly applies to the Three Houses who first entered Beleriand and their descendants.
Eglath	The Forsaken, a group of Teleri who remained behind in the coastal regions of Middle-earth to search for their lord Thingol, who had disappeared near the end of the Great Journey. These Elves missed their chance to cross the sea to Valinor when the island ferry departed without them, and they became part of the Sindar of Beleriand, dwelling in the lands that would become the realm of Doriath.
Eldar	Those Elves who accepted the summons of the Valar and began the Great Journey from Cuiviénen to Aman, even if they did not complete it. The name means "People of the Stars" and distinguishes them from the Avari who refused the call. The three kindreds of the Eldar were the Vanyar, Noldor, and Teleri, descending from the original three tribes of Minyar, Tatyar, and Nelyar.
Elves|Quendi	<i>Race:</i> <a href="bword://Quendi">Quendi</a><br><br>The Firstborn children of Ilúvatar, who awoke at Cuiviénen under the stars. Called Quendi, "The Speakers," for they were the first to use spoken language.

Ents	Ancient shepherds of the trees, placed upon Middle-earth by the will of Yavanna the Giver of Fruits in response to her concerns about the fate of growing things. These tree-like beings possessed great strength and longevity, dwelling in forests and protecting the olvar from harm. They were granted life and consciousness to serve as guardians of all that grows, though they moved slowly and spoke in a language as deep and long as the roots of mountains.
Falathrim	The coastal Sindar who dwelt along the shores of Beleriand, particularly under the lordship of Círdan the Shipwright. These Grey-elves became skilled mariners and craftsmen of the sea, maintaining havens at the Falas including the ports of Brithombar and Eglarest before their destruction in the wars against Morgoth.
Falmari	The People of the Waves, those Teleri who completed the Great Journey and dwelt in Aman, particularly in the coastal city of Alqualondë. Expert mariners and shipwrights, they crafted the renowned white ships of the Teleri and became the greatest sailors among the Elves. They maintained a special friendship with Ossë and Uinen, the Maiar of the seas, and their lord was Olwë, brother of Thingol.
Laiquendi	The Green Elves or Green People, those of the Nandor who later crossed the Blue Mountains and entered Beleriand, dwelling in the land of Ossiriand. Named for their attire which was often green to blend with the forests they loved, they were skilled in woodcraft and stealth, living lightly upon the land without building great cities or kingdoms. They joined the Sindar in the wars against Morgoth, though they preserved their distinct identity and customs.
Maiar	Spirits whose being began before the world, of the same order as the Valar but of lesser degree and power. These lesser Ainur served the greater Valar and fulfilled many roles in the shaping and governance of Arda, from tending the gardens of Lórien to bearing messages across great distances. Some, like Olórin and Curumo, would later be sent to Middle-earth in different forms, while others like Melian dwelt among the Children of Ilúvatar. Yet as beings of free will, some fell into darkness and became servants of Melkor.
Men	The Secondborn children of Ilúvatar, mortal beings who awoke in Hildórien when the Sun first rose, long after the Firstborn Elves. Granted the gift of mortality and freedom from the Music of the Ainur, their fate lay beyond the circles of the world in a mystery known only to Eru. Unlike the immortal Elves bound to Arda until its ending, Men would leave the world after death, though the shadow of Morgoth's corruption touched them early, and many fell under the dominion of darkness before ever meeting the Eldar.
Mithrim	Sindar who dwelt in the region around Lake Mithrim in northern Beleriand, among the Grey-elves who had remained in Middle-earth during the Great Journey. They witnessed the return of the Noldor and the rising of the Moon and Sun, dwelling in lands that would become crucial in the wars against Morgoth.
Moriquendi	Elves of Darkness, all those who did not behold the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor, including the Avari and initially the Sindar. The term was used by the Eldar of Aman to distinguish those who had seen the sacred light from those who had not. However, the Noldorin Exiles discovered that the Sindar found this term offensive, leading to a shift toward the geographic terms Amanyar and Úmanyar, with Moriquendi eventually being reserved primarily for the Avari and lesser-known Elven peoples.
Nandor	Those Elves who turn back, Teleri who refused to cross the Misty Mountains during the Great Journey and instead remained in the valley of Anduin. Led initially by Lenwë, they wandered in the wild lands east of the mountains, eventually spreading throughout the forests of Middle-earth. Some of their number, the Laiquendi, would later cross into Beleriand, but most remained in the eastern lands, their histories largely unrecorded in the annals of the Eldar.
Noldor	The Deep Elves or Wise, the second of the three kindreds of the Eldar, descending from the Tatyar who accepted the summons to Aman. Most skilled among the Elves in crafts and lore, they were beloved of Aulë the Smith who taught them much. Generally possessing dark hair of brown or black, they were led by Finwë to Valinor where they founded the great city of Tirion. Their insatiable thirst for knowledge and creation would eventually lead to their rebellion and return to Middle-earth in pursuit of the Silmarils.
Orcs	Creatures of Morgoth, twisted and corrupted beings created by the Dark Lord as foot soldiers in his wars against Elves and Men. According to some accounts, the first Orcs were made by capturing Elves and torturing them in the darkness until they were transformed into these monstrous forms, though their true origin remained a matter of debate among the wise. Bred for malice and destruction, they served the purposes of darkness throughout the ages.
Quendi	The Speakers, the name the Elves gave to themselves, for they were the first people to use spoken language in Middle-earth. The Firstborn children of Ilúvatar, they awoke at Cuiviénen under the stars long before the rising of the Sun and Moon. Immortal and bound to the fate of Arda, they were divided into many kindreds by the choices they made in response to the summons of the Valar.
Secondborn	Men, the younger children of Ilúvatar who awoke in Middle-earth millennia after the Elves, when the Sun first rose in the heavens. So named by the Firstborn to distinguish the two races of the Children, though the Secondborn were granted gifts and destinies different from their elder kindred, including the mystery of mortality and freedom from the circles of the world.
Sindar	The Grey-elves, those Teleri who began the Great Journey to Valinor but remained in Beleriand, never crossing the sea to the Blessed Realm. Many stayed to search for their lord Thingol who had disappeared, enchanted by Melian in the forests of Nan Elmoth. Under Thingol and Melian they established the great kingdom of Doriath and other realms in Beleriand, becoming a mighty people skilled in song and starlight, though they had never seen the Light of the Two Trees. They developed their own culture and language, distinct from both the Avari and the Calaquendi.
Teleri	The third and most numerous of the three kindreds of the Eldar, descending from the Nelyar who accepted the summons to Aman. During the Great Journey they became most scattered and divided, as many of their number turned aside or remained behind. Those who completed the journey to Valinor became the Falmari, master mariners of the coast of Eldamar, while those who remained in Middle-earth became the Sindar under Thingol. The Nandor who turned back at the Misty Mountains and the Laiquendi who later entered Beleriand were also of Telerin origin.
Trolls	Unintelligent humanoid creatures created by Morgoth before the First Age as servants and instruments of destruction. Made as mockeries of the Ents, though without the wisdom or nobility of Yavanna's shepherds, they served the Dark Lord's purposes in war and terror. Strong and brutal but slow of wit, they were vulnerable to sunlight which turned them to stone.
Úmanyar	Those not of Aman, the term the Noldorin Exiles used to describe those Eldar who set out on the Great Journey but remained in Middle-earth without completing it. This geographic designation particularly applied to the Sindar, but could encompass the Laiquendi and more broadly all the Nandor. The term arose as a more polite alternative to Moriquendi when the returning Noldor found that the Sindar were offended by being classified among the Elves of Darkness, despite their Grey-elven nobility and the greatness of their kingdoms.
Valar	The Powers of the World, the mightiest of the Ainur who entered Arda to complete its material development after the Music of the Ainur determined its form. Fourteen great spirits took up this responsibility, becoming the shapers and rulers of the world, each with particular dominion over aspects of creation. Dwelling in the Blessed Realm of Valinor in the Uttermost West, they guided the destiny of Arda and summoned the Elves to dwell with them in the light of the Two Trees.
Vanyar	The Fair Elves, the first and smallest of the three kindreds of the Eldar, descending from all the Minyar who accepted the summons to Valinor. All among them possessed golden hair, and they were the most beloved of Manwë and Varda, dwelling upon Taniquetil and in the plains of Valinor. Led by Ingwë, they were first to arrive in the Blessed Realm and never departed from it save when they marched to war against Morgoth in the final battle of the First Age.
